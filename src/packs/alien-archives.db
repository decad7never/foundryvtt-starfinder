These microscopic larvae cause an infection called void death, which functions as a disease. Those who perish from void death become void zombies. A void zombie looks like a walking rotting corpse, often with a bloated blue-gray “tongue”-the fanged tail of the parasitic larva inside-dangling from its broken skull where its lower jaw once was.<br/><br/>After a humanoid host dies from void death, the strongest of the akata larvae infesting the corpse worms its way to the host’s brain and undergoes a swift initial gestation within 2d4 hours. This accelerated growth causes the feeler-covered head of the oversized, tadpole-shaped parasite to latch onto the base of its victim’s brain and reenergize the dying organ, taking control and turning the host into a void zombie.<br/><br/>Akata larvae require 1d4 weeks as a second gestation before undergoing the transformation into adult akatas. A void zombie bearing an akata larva ready to emerge seeks out a secluded area and vomits the akata’s offspring into a shallow hole or crevice. The void zombie then “dies,” toppling over the disgorged larva. A scant 2d6 hours later, a full-grown akata emerges, usually taking the rotting corpse of its former host as its first meal.<br/><br/>Extra Content<br/><br/>The following extra content was found for

When the source of their power dwindled, the shatoris searched the planes for more eldritch energy. Their overreach led them to Abaddon, and when they retreated from that plane, an army of daemons followed them back to the Disaj system.<br><br>The daemons overwhelmed the defenses of Perdane, destroying civilization and the environment there. As the forces of Abaddon spread, the shatoris withdrew to Perdure, another world in their system, to plan. They knew their doom was a matter of time, so they hastily enacted a complex ritual that opened a demiplane to allow some of them to enter stasis for centuries. The complex spell was too rushed, though, and the survivors ended up in a pocket dimension connected to Pharasma’s Boneyard, where the shatoris slept for ages. As they did, the Boneyard’s energies altered them.<br><br>When their spell released them, the remaining shatoris were changed. They each retained great height and grace, but their flesh had become semitransparent and their bones limned with light. This combination makes shatoris’ eyes glow and their bones visible through their translucent flesh. Shatoris are living creatures, but centuries of exposure to the energies of the Boneyard have have extended each shatori’s natural life indefinitely and rendered them sterile.<br><br>The shatoris returned to Perdure a shattered people. They had witnessed their species’ near extinction and their civilization’s ruin. All their previous accomplishments had been razed to ruins, and their future seems to be one of slow attrition. Despair gripped survivors in the early days after their return. The wisest shatoris could see that their people’s despondency might accomplish what the daemons could not. Nine of these shatoris, called the Shabani, drafted a document called the Shaban, laying out ideal behavior and enshrining a culture of impartiality and tranquility, placing the objective over the subjective. The Shaban endorses detachment from the material world and rejects the worship of gods. It instead recommends philosophical egoism that leans toward benevolent self-interest, which includes working to benefit others, seeing the common good as an extension of personal welfare. Based on the Shaban, shatoris believe they should each find a purpose and use their gifts to fulfill that reason for existing, profiting themselves and others. According to the Shaban, inaction is the greatest sin—a wasted life dishonors the billions of shatoris who were denied the chance to live at all.<br><br>Shatoris see each death among them as a potentially catastrophic loss. Therefore, they seek to ensure their personal knowledge and culture is remembered even if they fail to survive, keeping detailed records. Shatoris also distribute their knowledge with little restraint, including to other sapient species.<br><br>When the Signal provided Drift travel to the shatoris, they had already expanded to Prevail, another world relatively untouched by the daemons in the Disaj system. Despite exploring Drift travel in theory, they remained in Disaj. When the Azlanti arrived in the Disaj system, the shatoris headed off conflict by offering their services as analysts, scholars, and magic‑users. The Disaj system became a vassal of the Azlanti Star Empire with no struggle. Shatoris serve the Azlanti with quiet obedience, fearing for their species’ survival. Still, some brave shatoris act subtly against the empire. As highly skilled servants, shatoris conduct research and fill bureaucratic roles essential to the empire’s stability and expansion. Many of these privileged positions allow shatoris to influence the course of the empire’s policy and future, and the stoic immortals hope the long-term impact of their actions changes the empire for the better of all.<br><br>The combination of shatori philosophy, dread of extinction, and desire for remembrance makes many averse to risk. Such shatoris remain in imperial space, hunting for ways to alter their fate. A few shatoris, however, are bold enough to take greater risks and travel the galaxy in search of answers and new possibilities.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Perdure)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or meeting (3-6)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Offense</h2>\n<h3>Connection</h3>\n<p>Akashic</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Humanoid","environment":"","cr":10,"xp":{"value":9600},"source":"AA3 pg. 94","subtype":"Shatori","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":19,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":24,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":24,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":19,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":19,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"medium","senses":"","languages":{"value":["azlanti","celestial","common","draconic","infernal"],"custom":"Perani"},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":"6","max":"6"},"spell2":{"value":"0","max":"0"},"spell3":{"value":"6","max":"6"},"spell4":{"value":"3","max":"3"},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Shatori Theorist","displayName":40,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"O8vibAjmLaxe5Alo","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.rp"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"flags":{},"name":"Dueling sword, buzzblade","type":"weapon","img":"systems/sfrpg/icons/equipment/weapons/dueling-sword.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>While dueling swords are crafted to be aesthetically pleasing and are often seen as a mark of rank or tradition, many warriors still train with them to deadly effect.

In fact, these intelligent guardians have been cultivated through centuries of genetic engineering and magic, and they are favored by the wealthy elite for their ability to keep out interlopers while avoiding the unsightly appearance of armed guards. Sentinel trees are capable of learning the difference between friend and foe, acknowledging temporary exceptions to their standard orders, and using their own judgment in handling corner cases.<br><br>Sentinel trees are usually employed for a pair of simple tasks: eliminating hostile intruders and maintaining the beauty of their surroundings. While capable of independent locomotion, sentinel trees rarely leave their original emplacements and typically do so only to track intruders or dispose of any unsightly bodies that result from their guard duties.<br><br>The aesthetic concerns of a sentinel tree are perhaps their greatest weakness. While unlikely to be fooled by disguises or tricks and trained to be alert for signs of stealthy foes, a sentinel tree often avoids making attacks that risk damaging their surrounding environments overmuch.<br><br>While a sentinel tree is unable to alter their own appearance, those who grow and sell them usually cultivate a wide variety of styles, replicating the general appearance of nearly any similar-sized plant, from perfectly squared hedges to succulent, evergreen, or broad-leafed trees. On worlds where greenery would stand out as unusual, sentinel trees are sometimes engineered to resemble thorny brambles, or even abstract crystalline

However, instead of struggling against their bonds, the velstracs subsumed their chains and eventually escaped into the Shadow Plane.<br><br>Velstracs leave the Shadow Plane to prey on sentient creatures. They maintain installations and portals in dark locales, launching forays into the Material Plane from such places. Most mortals who fall into velstrac clutches are doomed to live out the remainder of their days—or minutes—in agony. However, such mortals can sometimes become velstracs themselves. The supposed methods of this shift differ wildly, but all involve terrible suffering that only escalates after the transformation is complete. These newest velstracs often become anchorites, fiendish ascetics devoted to the torment of themselves as much as of others. An anchorite’s first act must be to willingly mutilate its flesh, showing its dedication to the velstrac way.<br><br>Anchorites are among the lowest-ranking fiends in the velstrac hierarchy. Often working in pairs or squads, they are crafters, gophers, and soldiers. Anchorite labor produces the majority of velstrac equipment, from their starships to their hide armors with inward-pointing studs and spikes. Anchorites take pains to make their creations macabre and ornate. These velstracs also make up the rank and file of velstrac exploration teams and starship crews.<br><br>In battle, anchorites aim to inflict maximum amounts of delicious agony upon themselves and their foes. Sharing pain is an ecstasy to anchorites as they guide each other along the path of evolution. Few velstracs of any sort refuse to telepathically pair with an anchorite and at least taste its pain, and it’s a rare and disgraceful act for an anchorite to refuse to share with another. A stronger velstrac who takes advantage of an anchorite to survive an otherwise deadly conflict is not considered to be acting dishonorably because in velstrac doctrine, the weak exist to serve the needs of the mighty. All velstracs answer to the demands of their strongest, the velstrac demagogues.</p>\n<h2>Velstrac Starships</h2>\n<p>A clear hierarchy commands all velstrac groupings, including the fiends’ starfaring forces. The velstracs’ fast and sleek&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonsrd.com/Starship_Examples.aspx?ItemName=Velstrac%20Corvette&amp;Family=Velstrac%20Starships\">corvettes</a>&nbsp;serve as heavy scouts and raiders, cutting into enemy territory and fleets like serrated blades. In starship combat, corvette crews fight as they would in personal combat, with the aim to deal maximum damage as brutally as possible. After strafing disabled ships with chain cannons, corvettes usually make boarding maneuvers to take prisoners. Corvette anchorite crews have even been known to use their escape pods as ballistic weapons against ships with weakened defenses, hoping to overcome those defenses and, perhaps, to improvise boarding at the same time.</p>\n<h2>Velstrac Flensers</h2>\n<p>Velstracs wield&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonsrd.com/WeaponDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Ascetic&amp;Family=Velstrac%20Flenser\">flensers</a>—blades designed to slice skin from muscle and muscle from bone—sometimes mounting these knives on rifles as bayonets. Flensers are honed to supernatural sharpness and powered to vibrate with the rhythms of the wielder’s body. Velstracs have mastered the art of using these advanced melee weapons to inflict wounds while keeping targets alive. The table above shows an array of flensers, which can be purchased only in the darkest corners of the galaxy.</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Shadow Plane)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, habit (3-6), or priory (7-12)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Outsider (evil, extraplanar, velstrac, lawful)","environment":"","cr":4,"xp":{"value":1200},"source":"AA 2 (p 128)","subtype":"Evil, Extraplanar, Velstrac, Lawful","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":"Unnerving gaze - 30 ft [DC 13]"},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":15,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":10,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":10,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":10,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":10,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"medium","senses":"darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision","languages":{"value":["common","infernal"],"custom":"Telepathy 30 ft"},"di":{"value":["cold"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{"sfrpg":{"conditions":[]}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Anchorite","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"KYJCiMN0CJSoHOLz","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"o7zXgcjx8bjaJron","flags":{},"name":"Paired Pain (Su)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"As a reaction after taking damage, an anchorite can telepathically link with a willing allied velstrac that it can see within 30 feet.

Infamously, Hellknight mages cover the inside of the armor with an infernal contract, infusing the creation with a minor devilish being forced into submission. Such armors serve as decorative sentinels in Hellknight facilities or disposable shock troops on the battlefield. The Knights of Golarion and Xenowardens use similar means to infuse armor with quiescent fragments of angelic will, elementals, or nature spirits. Eoxian technomancers instead instill armor with rudimentary unlife, sometimes using the remains of undead too damaged to operate without the artificial casing armor provides.<br><br>More technologically minded factions have similarly diverse approaches to creating animated armor. Technicians at the Qabarat University of Psychic and Technological Excellence have built on the psychically charged circuits of lashunta mind mail to create a sort of hybrid robot. These suits of mind mail combine artificial intelligence with psychic potential to become animated. Other groups, such as the Android Abolitionist Front, have a fondness for animated and sapient armor. Perceptionist members of the Front claim such armors, among other advanced artificial intelligences, must be protected as created people. One such Perceptionist, a zealot named 8-Karat, has begun liberating these constructs, using violence if necessary.<br><br>On Akiton, VitariTech Industries engages in unmonitored research into animated armor. The company recently claimed a long-abandoned shrine to Triune, using heavy security forces to keep interlopers out. Rumors indicate the corporation is using what it found within the site to build advanced constructs, including robot-like troops of animated heavy armor led by suits of powered armor.

At first glance, a xaarb appears to be an innocuous spherical lump of short, dark fur. Xaarbs have large eyes and four stout appendages, which they use to alternate between walking on all fours and standing upright. When frightened or riled, however, xaarbs can open their massive mouths to reveal jaws that take up most of their bodies, filled with long, pointy teeth.<br/><br/>Xaarb society is based entirely on physical dominance over other xaarbs-or anyone else they encounter. Xaarbs who have established supremacy over others can demand both obedience and tribute from their lessers, which is the expected method of gaining wealth and status; having to bargain or pay for something is considered an unspeakable shame. Only wars against other sapient species in Arybus allowed the xaarbs to stay united enough to become a starfaring race. Xaarbs eventually conquered their star system, but when interstellar travel via the Drift opened up the rest of the galaxy, xaarbs found themselves encountering-and outmatched by-both the Veskarium and the Azlanti Star Empire. This sobering paradigm shift shattered xaarb culture into three major factions. “Lesser” xaarbs accept that the vesk and Azlanti are dominant over them, and dutifully serve those races. “Greater” xaarbs muster their forces in order to some day conquer the other empires and reassert xaarb authority. “Unspoken” xaarbs-the most scattered of the species-feel that xaarb society has proven insufficient and now attempt to assimilate into and cooperate with other cultures. Unspoken xaarbs are considered the most reasonable of their kind by outside races, though their instinctual need to assert dominance at all occasionally surfaces.<br/><br/>Xaarbs are a species with only one gender, making gender roles a strange curiosity to them. They can understand the common languages of other species but can’t speak them. Their own language consists of a series of hand gestures and silent movements of their jaws. A particularly communicative xaarb might use a text-to-speech generator to talk to other species.<br/><br/>Site Owner: Blake DavisEmail Spam Checker: MX Guarddog</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section

If the creature’s attack roll hits the target’s KAC + 4, the creature also automatically grapples the foe as part of the attack action. (If it hits the target’s KAC + 13, it instead pins the target). The creature doesn’t need to have a free limb to perform this grapple. Unless otherwise specified, a creature can swallow whole only targets that are at least one size category smaller than itself, and it has room for a single target of that size in its stomach (doubling the maximum number of creatures it can have swallowed for each additional size category by which these creatures are smaller).\nOn the creature’s next turn after grappling or pinning the target, if the target has not escaped the grapple or pin, the target automatically takes the attack’s damage at the beginning of the creature’s turn. The creature can then make a new attack roll with the same attack. If the roll equals or exceeds the target’s KAC, the grapple or pin is maintained. If the roll equals or exceeds the target’s KAC + 4, the target is swallowed whole (no damage is dealt).\nOnce swallowed, the target takes the listed swallow whole damage automatically at the beginning of its turn every round. The target is considered grappled as long as it is swallowed. The target can attempt to cut its way out (the interior of a creature with swallow whole has the same EAC as its exterior and a KAC equal to that of its exterior – 4) by dealing an amount of damage equal to onequarter the swallowing creature’s total Hit Points, though any attack that does not deal slashing damage deals only half its normal damage. If a target cuts its way out of the creature, the creature cannot use swallow whole again until that damage is healed.\nAlternatively, a target swallowed whole can attempt to climb out. The swallowed creature must succeed at both a grapple check against the creature’s internal KAC + 8 and an Athletics check to climb (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × the creature’s CR). Each of these actions takes a full round. If both checks are successful, the target climbs back up to the creature’s mouth and can escape, ending up in an open square adjacent to the creature.\nOffensive Abilities swallow whole (5d4+16 A, EAC 30, KAC 27, 71 HP).<br/>Guidelines: Use the same damage amount as for the creature’s standard melee attack.","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Alien Archive 3 pg. 154, Alien Archive 2 pg. 153, Alien Archive pg. 156","type":"","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"target":{"value":"","type":""},"area":{"value":null,"units":null,"shape":"","effect":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":null,"additional":"","per":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"ability":"","actionType":"mwak","attackBonus":15,"chatFlavor":"EAC 17, KAC 15, 18 HP","critical":{"parts":[],"effect":""},"damage":{"parts":[["1d6+10","acid"]]},"formula":"","save":{"type":"","dc":null,"descriptor":"negate"},"descriptors":[],"modifiers":[],"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"abilityMods":{"parts":[]}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"},{"_id":"3whYjjwsrXcUQ5Fc","flags":{},"name":"1 Battery (20 Charges","type":"goods","data":{"description":{"value":"","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","type":"","quantity":"1","bulk":"L","price":0,"level":1,"attuned":false,"equipped":false,"identified":true,"modifiers":[]},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"},{"_id":"idfMM7Tnww2iATHQ","flags":{},"name":"Screamer Grenades I (2)","type":"goods","data":{"description":{"value":"","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","type":"","quantity":1,"bulk":"L","price":0,"level":1,"attuned":false,"equipped":false,"identified":true,"modifiers":[]},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg"}],"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","_id":"8lGVFc69fMVtsjBp"}

Two such specialists are the ambassador and the predator drone.<br/><br/>Anacite ambassadors travel to foster diplomatic relations. Most often members of Those Who Become, anacite ambassadors serve on Aballonian seedships as emissaries. Anacite ambassadors can easily learn languages. Further, although they are not warriors, ambassadors can protect themselves with built-in lasers. To avoid tension during diplomacy, ambassadors keep this weapon retracted until it’s needed, though they usually notify their hosts about the laser unless there’s a good reason to keep it a secret.<br/><br/>An anacite predator drone resembles a rhinoceros beetle made of silvery metal with a reddish shell that opens to reveal enormous wings. The drone’s weapons are part of its body, leaving its wings and appendages free. Countless drones police the megaplexes of Aballon. Others serve as soldiers for anacites that have greater authority, fighting in places such as the Midnight Trenches.<br/><br/>Anacite Powered Armor<br/><br/>Arms manufacturers in the Aballonian megaplex of Pursuit produce powered armor that mimics the versatile and customizable capabilities of anacite laborers. Anacites who subscribe to the philosophy of Those Who Become promote this powered armor as a good way for non-anacites to experience the superiority of the constructed form.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Aballon)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary or pair</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","public":""},"type":"Construct (technological)","environment":"","cr":6,"xp":{"value":2400},"source":"AA2 (pg. 10)","subtype":"Technological","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":13,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":18,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":18,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":13,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":13,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"medium","senses":"darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision","languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":"Up, Shortwave"},"di":{"value":[],"custom":"Construct Immunities"},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":"Light Dependency"},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":"Construct Immunities"},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Anacite Ambassador","displayName":40,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":60,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"Xp25Jtrp6d1LIZqZ","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"flags":{},"name":"Retractable Laser (Ex)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"An anacite ambassador’s retractable laser has a range increment of 90 feet.

Millennia of domestication and parallel evolution have strengthened the symbiotic bond between the two species, allowing lashuntas to form a close mental link with a chosen mount.<br><br>Shotalashus have rudimentary telepathic abilities similar to those of the lashuntas themselves, a fact that has contributed to their use as close pets and trusted mounts even in the modern day, when much more sophisticated and technologically advanced forms of both transportation and companionship exist. This tradition has lasted so long in part because of the kinship the lashuntas feel with their bonded shotalashus, but also because the symbiotic bond between the two species is deeply ingrained into lashunta culture. Shotalashu-mounted cavalry still serve as ceremonial honor guards for lashunta dignitaries, and members of all social stations regard their bonded mounts as occupying a cherished place in the family. Though shotalashus are seen less often in teeming metropolises than they are in smaller settlements, no city on Castrovel is devoid of at least basic amenities for the honored beasts, from training facilities to boarding services.<br><br>While it’s common for a lashunta to switch between shotalashus throughout her life, some bonds between beast and rider deepen over time, and it is not unheard of for a warrior to bond with a single shotalashu mount until death. Lashunta whose mounts die suffer psychic trauma and often require time to recover before they can bond with another mount, and shotalashus who lose their bonded riders have been known to grieve for months, or even years.<br><br>Though rare, some shotalashus still live in the wild, forming feral packs that use their telepathy to bond not with a rider, but with one another, forming a highly effective collective mind that makes them efficient and deadly hunters. Particularly adventurous lashuntas set out on solo quests into the most remote of Castrovel’s wilds in search of a potentially stronger mount from among untamed stock. These brave souls must first break an individual shotalashu away from its pack before attempting the long and arduous task of taming and eventually bonding with the creature.<br><br>A typical domesticated shotalashu is over 10 feet long from snout to tail-tip, and weighs more than 1,000 pounds, while wild specimens can grow as large as 12 feet in length and weigh a staggering 1,500 pounds.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Shotalashu Equipment</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;As technology has advanced, telepathic bonding with shotalashus has become possible for those who aren’t lashunta.

Solar wisps are blobs of ejecta from a sun’s corona that have taken on a modicum of sentience. No one is exactly sure how solar wisps originate, though some believe it is Sarenrae’s divine will, while others point toward a consciousness similar to that of elementals, claiming that solar wisps are nothing more than cousins of fire elementals. But while it is true solar wisps are amorphous orbs of burning plasma with almost animal-level intelligence, the similarities end there. These creatures have a long and unique life cycle that begins in a star and can end in calamity.<br><br>When a solar wisp is “born,” it measures about 20 feet in diameter, but the material of its being is loosely held together by minor gravitational forces. At this point, a solar wisp isn’t much more than a red-hot cloud of colloidal matter. Driven by instinct, the solar wisp attaches itself to a nearby fast-moving celestial body (usually a comet), which eventually takes it close to a planet or moon containing the minerals on which the solar wisp feeds. As it burns its way across such a landscape, the solar wisp gains more mass but shrinks in size. Responding to unknown stimuli, the solar wisp launches itself back into space to latch onto another comet or meteor to repeat the process.<br><br>As a solar wisp feeds and ages, it increases in density but decreases in diameter. Despite its reduction in size to a mere few feet in diameter, a mature solar wisp burns with far greater intensity and is much more dangerous than a juvenile. A solar wisp of any age and size can pose a threat, however, as it is unwavering in its pursuit of food, consuming the minerals it seeks out in its internal furnace. This can be a destructive process that puts it in conflict with other species—especially if those species also rely on the same minerals for economic stability. Most creatures that attempt to stop a mature solar wisp underestimate its abilities thanks to its small size. Its effects on local gravity and its intense heat mean that most who confront a solar wisp are lucky if they get away with only severe burns.<br><br>Though it has a life span measured in centuries—and sometimes multiple thousands of years—a solar wisp does eventually die. An elderly solar wisp is a tiny ball that burns like a nuclear explosion, and when it expires, it implodes into a gravitational singularity that affects a half-mile radius. Though this miniature black hole lasts for less than an hour, it poses a great danger to those caught in its pull. A recent report from Near Space tells of an entire nascent colony wiped out by a dying solar wisp that, until then, had served as a kind of mascot and beacon for the unfortunate settlers.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Photino Crystals</h2>\n<p>In their travels, solar wisps sometimes shed portions of themselves, which cool rapidly into a glittering stream of beautiful bright-orange jewels called photino crystals&nbsp;that are used throughout the Pact Worlds (and beyond) as naturally occurring solarian weapon crystals. A few small starship crews make a dangerous living by following wisps— at a great distance—and waiting for this molting, scooping up the resulting jewels until their cargo holds are full, and then returning to a safer location to sort them by quality.

Apex predators of terrifying strength and agility, these beasts combine feline and reptilian traits in a robust quadrupedal form armed with long claws and crushing jaws. None of these are what make the stroxha truly dangerous, however. Their legendary ambush capabilities derive not from superior stealth or camouflage, but their capacity to sense and charge prey through solid objects.<br><br>A stroxha’s eyes are highly advanced sensors capable of detecting a range of electromagnetic radiation from X-rays to microwaves. This sight, combined with phase-shifting abilities born of fey ancestry, allows a stroxha to spot a creature and close on it before the prey has a chance to spot danger.<br><br>Because each individual stroxha needs a vast hunting ground, stroxhas rarely congregate for any purpose other than breeding. Stroxhas bear few cubs, usually one or two, with the parents taking turns rearing the young so neither’s territory becomes overhunted. Stroxha culture is based around an honor hierarchy, with displays of force and dominance determining who controls the choicest territory. Their language is a complex combination of hisses, growls, and body cues, and they are capable of comprehending other languages with sufficient exposure.<br><br>Maraquoi revere stroxhas as symbols of fierce cunning. The people of Marata were once among the beasts’ prey, but the maraquoi have begun defending the increasingly rare predators. With extraplanetary interests applying more pressure for access to Marata’s highly protected environmental resources, poachers have begun to hunt stroxhas, and over time, stroxhas came to recognize the protection the maraquoi have afforded them. An alliance now exists between the mighty predators and their erstwhile prey to protect their mutual home world.<br><br>A typical adult stroxha is 10 feet long and weighs 500 pounds.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>temperate or warm forests (Marata)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or guard (1-2 plus a maraquoi warband)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Magical Beast","environment":"","cr":8,"xp":{"value":4800},"source":"A!04 pg. 22","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":16,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":21,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":21,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":16,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"large","senses":"blindsight (vision) 60 ft., darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision, sense through (vision) 30 ft.","languages":{"value":[],"custom":"Stroxha"},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Stroxha","displayName":40,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"aT34olq4qYf8NaFB","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false,"lightColor":"","mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false},"items":[{"flags":{},"name":"Phase (Su)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"Stroxhas exist slightly out of phase with the Material Plane.

Their eyes glow visibly, increasing in brightness as they absorb force energy. Witchwyrds stand an average of 7 feet tall and weigh approximately 300 pounds. They favor loose, flowing robes and distinctive conical hats, and they frequently cover their faces with masks or ornate helmets. Witchwyrds new to a market or eager to avoid identification during an important business deal sometimes fold one pair of their flexible arms behind their backs and cover their faces.<br><br>Although witchwyrds seem to gain some manner of sustenance from the magical force energy they absorb, they still breathe, drink, eat, and sleep like normal creatures, and they have a fondness for extremely spicy foods. The average lifespan of witchwyrds is unknown, though they are believed to live for many centuries, if not millennia.<br><br>Witchwyrds are acknowledged as the progenitors of the kasathas and the shobhads of Akiton. Why the witchwyrds seeded Kasath and Akiton with intelligent life modeled after themselves remains a mystery, as does the number of other as-yet-undiscovered planets similarly affected. It is an undisputed fact, however, that witchwyrds were the impetus behind the construction of the kasathas’ worldship Idari and their exodus from their home planet to the Pact Worlds.<br><br>Witchwyrds can be found on nearly any world or plane with civilized trade, preferring dry, warm regions, but virtually nothing is known of their mysterious home world beyond its name: Cyrune. The details of witchwyrd government and society are likewise unknown, other than a widespread belief that a mercantile oligarchy of witchwyrd elders directs their race’s interplanetary and interplanar trade.<br><br>Most witchwyrds operate as solitary traders, primarily focusing on one area of trade (such as weapons or magic items), though most deal in other goods as well. Virtually all witchwyrds love haggling, to the point that the process of bargaining sometimes seems more important to a witchwyrd than the eventual deal that is struck.<br><br>Witchwyrds often travel with a crew of loyal humanoid mercenaries hired from worlds they’ve visited in the past. These hirelings never speak of their remuneration, purportedly forbidden from doing so by punitive clauses in their contracts. Witchwyrds can be encountered throughout the Pact Worlds, though they’re most commonly found on Absalom Station, Akiton, and the Idari. On the Pact Worlds, most witchwyrds do business as members of the Tetrad, an interplanetary and interplanar trade association.<br><br>Tetrad Caravel<br><br>The Tetrad manufactures its own line of starships using unique hybrid technology, including proprietary planar aperture drives that enable the witchwyrds to travel between planes as well as into the Drift. Under no circumstances are these engines sold to non-witchwyrds. In the Pact Worlds, one of the most commonly encountered style of witchwyrd starships is the Tetrad Caravel, named after an ancient oceangoing vessel.<br><br>Extra Content<br><br>The following extra content was found for this creature:<br><br>- Witchwyrd Race Entry<br><br>Site Owner: Blake DavisEmail Spam Checker: MX Guarddog</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, entourage (1 plus 2-5 humanoid guards), or enclave (2-5 plus 11-20 humanoid guards)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Monstrous Humanoid","environment":"","cr":6,"xp":{"value":2400},"source":"AA 1 (p 122)","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":18,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":13,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":18,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":13,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":13,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"medium","senses":"darkvision 60 ft.","languages":{"value":["common","kasatha","shobhad"],"custom":"Cyrunian; Tongues"},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":"Energy 5"},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"damageReduction":{"value":5,"negatedBy":"magic"},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":"0","max":"0"},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":"0","max":"0"},"spell4":{"value":"0","max":"0"},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{"sfrpg":{"conditions":[]}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Witchwyrd","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"LYiGNBw5pHhWsiao","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"a23EpiqQChWDNSgV","flags":{},"name":"Absorb Force (Su)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"As a reaction, a witchwyrd can use any number of its free hands to catch magic missiles (from the spell of the same name) fired at it.

Two such specialists are the ambassador and the predator drone.<br/><br/>Anacite ambassadors travel to foster diplomatic relations. Most often members of Those Who Become, anacite ambassadors serve on Aballonian seedships as emissaries. Anacite ambassadors can easily learn languages. Further, although they are not warriors, ambassadors can protect themselves with built-in lasers. To avoid tension during diplomacy, ambassadors keep this weapon retracted until it’s needed, though they usually notify their hosts about the laser unless there’s a good reason to keep it a secret.<br/><br/>An anacite predator drone resembles a rhinoceros beetle made of silvery metal with a reddish shell that opens to reveal enormous wings. The drone’s weapons are part of its body, leaving its wings and appendages free. Countless drones police the megaplexes of Aballon. Others serve as soldiers for anacites that have greater authority, fighting in places such as the Midnight Trenches.<br/><br/>Anacite Powered Armor<br/><br/>Arms manufacturers in the Aballonian megaplex of Pursuit produce powered armor that mimics the versatile and customizable capabilities of anacite laborers. Anacites who subscribe to the philosophy of Those Who Become promote this powered armor as a good way for non-anacites to experience the superiority of the constructed form.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Aballon)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or squadron (3-6)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","public":""},"type":"Construct (technological)","environment":"","cr":10,"xp":{"value":9600},"source":"AA2 (pg. 10)","subtype":"Technological","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":19,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":24,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":19,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":19,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"large","senses":"blindsight (heat) 60 ft., darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision","languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":"Shortwave"},"di":{"value":[],"custom":"Construct Immunities"},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":"Sunlight Dependency"},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":"Construct Immunities"},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Anacite Predator Drone","displayName":40,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":60,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"lHpBe3r2CLQzscCX","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"flags":{},"name":"Integrated Weapons","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"The creature’s weapons are manufactured weapons, not natural weapons, and they are integrated into its frame.

Millennia of domestication and parallel evolution have strengthened the symbiotic bond between the two species, allowing lashuntas to form a close mental link with a chosen mount.<br><br>Shotalashus have rudimentary telepathic abilities similar to those of the lashuntas themselves, a fact that has contributed to their use as close pets and trusted mounts even in the modern day, when much more sophisticated and technologically advanced forms of both transportation and companionship exist. This tradition has lasted so long in part because of the kinship the lashuntas feel with their bonded shotalashus, but also because the symbiotic bond between the two species is deeply ingrained into lashunta culture. Shotalashu-mounted cavalry still serve as ceremonial honor guards for lashunta dignitaries, and members of all social stations regard their bonded mounts as occupying a cherished place in the family. Though shotalashus are seen less often in teeming metropolises than they are in smaller settlements, no city on Castrovel is devoid of at least basic amenities for the honored beasts, from training facilities to boarding services.<br><br>While it’s common for a lashunta to switch between shotalashus throughout her life, some bonds between beast and rider deepen over time, and it is not unheard of for a warrior to bond with a single shotalashu mount until death. Lashunta whose mounts die suffer psychic trauma and often require time to recover before they can bond with another mount, and shotalashus who lose their bonded riders have been known to grieve for months, or even years.<br><br>Though rare, some shotalashus still live in the wild, forming feral packs that use their telepathy to bond not with a rider, but with one another, forming a highly effective collective mind that makes them efficient and deadly hunters. Particularly adventurous lashuntas set out on solo quests into the most remote of Castrovel’s wilds in search of a potentially stronger mount from among untamed stock. These brave souls must first break an individual shotalashu away from its pack before attempting the long and arduous task of taming and eventually bonding with the creature.<br><br>A typical domesticated shotalashu is over 10 feet long from snout to tail-tip, and weighs more than 1,000 pounds, while wild specimens can grow as large as 12 feet in length and weigh a staggering 1,500 pounds.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Shotalashu Equipment</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;As technology has advanced, telepathic bonding with shotalashus has become possible for those who aren’t lashunta.

Yaruks are infamously destructive in their ongoing migrations, toppling whatever isn’t convenient to walk around. This has hidden benefits, though. Not only does this create natural pathways and game trails that other species exploit, but it also clears swaths through thick canopies, allowing for new growth.<br/><br/>While most yaruks are solitary, they regularly call to their neighbors with deafening bellows magnified by their hollow crests.

They were formed by mystical vibrations between the Elemental and Ethereal Planes, coalescing pure ethereal energy into the first of these sentient beings. These tiny creatures gathered into nomadic groups that wandered the Elemental Planes. They approached their lives with joy and wonder, marveling at the spectacular beauty and vast bounty of new experiences that their home had to offer. They were sensitive to the subtle interactions and resonances between sources of elemental energy and perceived these resonances as a musical expression of the nature of reality. The wysps most skilled at reading and manipulating this music, called wysp conductors, rapidly rose to positions of leadership within their communities. These conductors largely operated independently from one another but occasionally collaborated on projects of a particularly grand scale. Perhaps the greatest of all of these endeavors was what wysps refer to as the “song of creation”—a performance in which a large group of wysps harmonizes with an Elemental Plane to give birth to new members of their kind.<br>As their numbers grew, the largely peaceful and curious wysps drew the attention of the elemental lords, demigods who inhabit the Elemental Planes. The elemental lords saw great value in the wysps’ understanding of elemental resonances, and sought to turn it toward their own ends. To make the wysps into better minions, the elemental lords revised their song of creation, producing new generations of wysps with innate tendencies toward service and self-sacrifice. Over time, these generations lost some of their connection to the music of the universe. These new wysps became specialized, turning into air, earth, fire, and water wysps as they were each attuned to a single Elemental Plane. Despite all these changes, these modified wysps retained the cheerful and curious disposition of their ancestors.<br>While most wysps lead lives dedicated to the service of other elemental beings, a few small groups of wysps have escaped the influence of the elemental lords and returned to lifestyles more akin to their ancestors. Led by wysp conductors who have regained their natural affinity for the music of creation, these bands of wysps rarely stay in one place for long. Free symphonies of wysps tend to be cautious around anyone they suspect may want to take away their independence, responding to potential dangers by fleeing across the planes rather than engaging in confrontation.</span></p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Elemental Planes)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, cloud (2-8), retinue (3-6 plus another creature with a matching elemental subtype), or symphony (5-20 plus one wysp conductor)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"outsider (elemental, extraplanar)","environment":"","cr":2,"xp":{"value":600},"source":"","aura":"Resonance - 30 Ft.","raceAndGrafts":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":12,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":7,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":7,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":12,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":12,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"tiny","senses":"darkvision 60 ft.","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":"Elemental Immunities"},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":"Elemental Immunities"},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{"sfrpg":{"conditions":[]}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Wysp","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"qWtxyYKNo3VulCjw","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{},"bar2":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"S6frMakUZ3PP3WHa","flags":{},"name":"Resonance (Ex)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"The elemental energy of a wysp resonates with the bodies of creatures that share its elemental subtype.

Each shakalta is born as a soul, appearing as a mote of glowing energy with a vague face and fully developed mind. A juvenile inherits a great amount of knowledge and spends their first few years receiving intensive telepathic education from their parents. A shakalta develops their identity and personality during this time. After a few years, a shakalta child is considered ready to become an adult.<br><br>To enter adulthood, two shakalta souls must bond together. Young shakaltas travel to Accara IV seeking a partner to bond with. Psychic compatibility and spiritual connection are all that matter to potential soul partners, and both souls must consent for this bonding to work. The deep link between bonded shakalta souls is one that surpasses trust and love. When two shakaltas agree to bond, they intertwine, creating a body of coherent energy to share, living the rest of their lives in this intimate proximity.<br><br>A shakalta’s body has only one soul controlling outward activities at a given time. The inactive soul recedes and rests, conscious only of its mate. Cosmetic changes in the body reffect the active soul’s sense of itself. These visual variations allow nonpsychic creatures to tell each soul from the other.<br><br>The culture of the shakaltas is deeply spiritual. Arrival in the galaxy as energy makes it easy for shakaltas to value knowledge, mysticism, and other immaterial concepts over objects and wealth. Shakaltas revere Yaraesa, the light of wisdom, and Sarenrae, the light of life. The two deities are often represented together in shakalta shrines, as separate luminosities unified in an eternal balance. Shakaltas spend their long lives seeking experiences and attempting to bring light and positivity to existence. Many shakaltas remain on Accara IV, gathering in family-like groups and living lives of quiet devotion to their deities, philosophy, and one another. However, some shakaltas feel a calling to leave their home world for a greater purpose. Members of the shakalta Star-Guardians exemplify this urge, their loose coalition dedicated to traveling the galaxy and defending it against evil.<br><br>The shakalta belief in the balance of dualities extends even to life and death. When a shakalta decides to reproduce, each bonded soul contributes vitality to create a kernel of psychic energy. The shakalta carries this “embryo” inside their body for 18 months. A juvenile shakalta called a neophyte then emerges without effort, immediately ready to begin its education. Conversely, some shakaltas agree to peacefully end their lives before natural death, seeing their passing as another avenue of exploration. Shakaltas believe their souls reincarnate and that bonded souls can find their partners in the next life, which might not be as shakaltas.<br><br>Shakaltas average 6-1/2 feet in height and weigh about 100 pounds. Shakaltas live for well over 500 years.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Accara IV)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary or pair</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Offense</h2>\n<h3>Connection</h3>\n<p>star shaman</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Humanoid","environment":"","cr":7,"xp":{"value":3200},"source":"AA3 pg. 92","subtype":"Shakalta","aura":"Light - 5 Ft.","raceAndGrafts":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":14,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":19,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":14,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":14,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"medium","senses":"","languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":"Limited Telepathy 30 ft."},"di":{"value":[],"custom":"Disease, Poison"},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":"Star Sustenance"},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":"Disease, Poison"},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":"3","max":"3"},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Shakalta Star-Guardian","displayName":40,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"jLLb37mslDwrr6gg","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"flags":{},"name":"Aura of Light (Ex)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">The light level increases by one step within 10 feet of a shakalta.

At 1st level, you automatically learn the black hole and supernova stellar revelations. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you learn an additional stellar revelation. You cannot select the same stellar revelation more than once unless it says otherwise. You can choose any stellar revelations you wish, but if you have more photon revelations than graviton revelations, or vice versa, it is more difficult to become fully attuned in either mode (see Disproportionate Revelations on page 104). The list of stellar revelations begins on page 103.<br><br>Stellar revelations normally note what kind of action they require. If a stellar revelation does not note the kind of action it takes and it modifies some other action (such as an attack or skill check), it can be used as part of that action. If a stellar revelation allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your solarian level + your Charisma modifier. A revelation that says it lasts for 1 round or until you leave the associated mode lasts for whichever of these durations is longer. You can use stellar revelations both in and out of combat, but since you can’t enter a stellar mode outside of battle, any revelation that lasts for 1 round or as long as you’re in a stellar mode lasts only 1 round if you’re not in combat.</span></p>\n        <p><sub><img src=\"systems/sfrpg/images/cup/gameplay/graviton.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"25\" height=\"25\"></sub>&nbsp;Graviton

Originally native to the Parapet Mountains on Triaxus, wollipeds were among the first animals the ryphorians domesticated. On Triaxus, ryphorians have raised wollipeds as livestock for thousands of years. With the advent of Drift travel, however, wollipeds have spread to other planets beyond the Pact Worlds.<br><br>In the wild, wollipeds are herd animals. When threatened, they gather in a tight cluster, adults on the outside with their tusks facing outward, and the young and infirm herd members protected in the center. Wollipeds also spit as a defense mechanism. They developed spiting to warn off competitors for choice food. However, if attacked or sufficiently upset, a wolliped vomits the half-digested contents of its stomach to scare off attackers. Wolliped defensive clusters rain this spit on would-be attackers, often driving off all but the hardiest of predators.<br><br>On Triaxus, herds of wild wollipeds migrate great distances during the planet’s harsh winters in search of food. Most wollipeds are herbivores. Those dwelling in high altitudes or areas with sparse vegetation feed on lichens, mosses, and tubers. Wollipeds of the plains graze on grasses and leaves.<br><br>Like ryphorians, wollipeds have adapted to Triaxus’s long seasons, regardless of what planet they inhabit. Wollipeds born in the winter (Triaxus’s current season) have long, thick, shaggy coats. Those born in the summer have shorter, thinner coats. Winterborn wollipeds grow much longer tusks than their summerborn kindred, using them to dig into the ice and snow for burmoss, roots and rhizomes, tubers, and patches of sentient tulbos fungus. All wollipeds also clash their tusks in dominance competitions and mating displays.<br><br>Wollipeds are exceptionally surefooted, able to easily climb steep mountain trails and maneuver in deep snow. This ability to navigate challenging environments, as well as their docile nature, made wollipeds a natural choice for domestication. Of greatest value is the wollipeds’ fleece, which can be spun and woven into warm, water-repellent textiles. Wollipeds are also raised for their meat, and some ryphorians drink a potent alcohol made from fermented wolliped milk for traditional celebrations and rituals. Wollipeds also make fine mounts and beasts of burden.<br><br>Herds of domesticated wollipeds can be found all over Triaxus, from the Allied Territories to Ning. Most are raised for their fleece, but more than half of Triaxus’s domesticated wolliped production goes to feeding the population of the Drakelands. The same traits that led to the domestication of wollipeds on Triaxus have made them valuable as hardy livestock on cold or mountainous colony worlds. In a pinch, colonists can use them for physical labor, just as the ryphorians did in pre-Gap times.<br><br>A typical wolliped is about 12 feet long from nose to base of tail, stands 5 feet tall at the front shoulder, and weighs around 3,000 pounds. Wollipeds mate annually and give birth after 11 months. Most wollipeds live for about 15 years.</p>\n<h2>Regional Variants</h2>\n<p>The wolliped statistics represent the most common breed native to Triaxus, but other breeds exist across the world. These beasts are available off-world as well.<br><br>Alural:&nbsp;Ryphorian tribes of the Alural Plains in the Drakelands have long bred the strongest and most aggressive wollipeds. They start with the only known carnivorous strain of wollipeds, which aren’t docile like their herbivorous kin. Alural trainers then prepare the wollipeds for riders and war. For those who prefer the ancient tradition of riding a wolliped into battle, this variety is widely regarded as the best. The alural war wolliped statistics represent a combat-trained, armored wolliped. A wild alural is like a normal wolliped, but it lacks the docile weakness.<br><br>Ningese:&nbsp;The island continent Ning on Triaxus is home to a small breed of wolliped, known for its hardiness, speed, and agility. Ningese wolliped fleece is fine and soft, and the animals’ tender meat is considered a delicacy on Triaxus. Both are rare luxuries elsewhere, because the Immortal Suzerainty of Ning claims independence from the Pact Worlds, and Ning’s exports carry severe tariffs and shipping restrictions. Ningese wollipeds have the miniature simple template, Strength +2 (1d6+5 B damage for their gore), Dexterity and initiative +4, and their speed is 60 feet.</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>cold hills, mountains, or plains (Triaxus)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or mounted (1 alural war wolliped and 1

When Triune bestowed Drift technology to the universe, svartalfars channeled their vengeful energies away from the fey who expelled them to focus on an inscrutable endgame spanning both the galaxy and the planes. Many of these calculating killers have realized that the universal currencies of money and power can advance their race further than can the arcane knowledge they once sought as payment for their services.</p>\n<h2>Velstrac</h2>\n<p>Sometimes called “kytons” by mortals, velstracs are cruel fiends who dwell on the Shadow Plane. Each velstrac seeks to unlock its highest potential by following a path of methodical, self-inflicted pain while also psychically feeding on the fear and anguish of mortal creatures. Velstracs care only for this path of pain and its mystical destination; they see “lesser” beings as nothing more than stepping-stones for their own ascension.<br><br>Transformation requires a velstrac to excise pieces of itself, spiritually and physically. Dross is cut away and replaced with grafts—artificial or natural, flesh or spirit, magical or technological. Each graft brings the velstrac closer to its ideal state and increases its power. In this practice, velstracs are more fanatical than even the Augmented are about cybernetic augmentations. The emotions and pain experienced during each step, they believe, cause spiritual evolution.<br><br>Legend holds that the first velstracs emerged when mortals conceived of cruelty as an acceptable means of personal advancement. The goodly gods, astonished and dismayed, chained the velstracs in Hell. However, instead of struggling against their bonds, the velstracs subsumed their chains and eventually escaped into the Shadow Plane.<br><br>Velstracs leave the Shadow Plane to prey on sentient creatures. They maintain installations and portals in dark locales, launching forays into the Material Plane from such places. Most mortals who fall into velstrac clutches are doomed to live out the remainder of their days—or minutes—in agony. However, such mortals can sometimes become velstracs themselves. The supposed methods of this shift differ wildly, but all involve terrible suffering that only escalates after the transformation is complete. These newest velstracs often become anchorites, fiendish ascetics devoted to the torment of themselves as much as of others. An anchorite’s first act must be to willingly mutilate its flesh, showing its dedication to the velstrac way.<br><br>Anchorites are among the lowest-ranking fiends in the velstrac hierarchy. Often working in pairs or squads, they are crafters, gophers, and soldiers. Anchorite labor produces the majority of velstrac equipment, from their starships to their hide armors with inward-pointing studs and spikes. Anchorites take pains to make their creations macabre and ornate. These velstracs also make up the rank and file of velstrac exploration teams and starship crews.<br><br>In battle, anchorites aim to inflict maximum amounts of delicious agony upon themselves and their foes. Sharing pain is an ecstasy to anchorites as they guide each other along the path of evolution. Few velstracs of any sort refuse to telepathically pair with an anchorite and at least taste its pain, and it’s a rare and disgraceful act for an anchorite to refuse to share with another. A stronger velstrac who takes advantage of an anchorite to survive an otherwise deadly conflict is not considered to be acting dishonorably because in velstrac doctrine, the weak exist to serve the needs of the mighty. All velstracs answer to the demands of their strongest, the velstrac demagogues.</p>\n<h2>Velstrac Starships</h2>\n<p>A clear hierarchy commands all velstrac groupings, including the fiends’ starfaring forces. The velstracs’ fast and sleek&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonsrd.com/Starship_Examples.aspx?ItemName=Velstrac%20Corvette&amp;Family=Velstrac%20Starships\">corvettes</a>&nbsp;serve as heavy scouts and raiders, cutting into enemy territory and fleets like serrated blades. In starship combat, corvette crews fight as they would in personal combat, with the aim to deal maximum damage as brutally as possible. After strafing disabled ships with chain cannons, corvettes usually make boarding maneuvers to take prisoners. Corvette anchorite crews have even been known to use their escape pods as ballistic weapons against ships with weakened defenses, hoping to overcome those defenses and, perhaps, to improvise boarding at the same time.</p>\n<h2>Velstrac Flensers</h2>\n<p>Velstracs wield&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonsrd.com/WeaponDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Ascetic&amp;Family=Velstrac%20Flenser\">flensers</a>—blades designed to slice skin from muscle and muscle from bone—sometimes mounting these knives on rifles as bayonets. Flensers are honed to supernatural sharpness and powered to vibrate with the rhythms of the wielder’s body. Velstracs have mastered the art of using these advanced melee weapons to inflict wounds while keeping targets alive. The table above shows an array of flensers, which can be purchased only in the darkest corners of the galaxy.</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Shadow Plane)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair,&nbsp;escort (1d4 plus 1 velstrac of lower CR), or entourage (2d6 plus 1 velstrac of higher CR)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","public":""},"type":"Outsider (evil, extraplanar, lawful, velstrac)","environment":"","cr":11,"xp":{"value":12800},"source":"AP #11 (p 61)","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":"Unnerving gaze - 30 ft.

Life is barely sustainable on Lajok, and as its sun grows dimmer, it might be able to sustain an ecosphere for only a few more centuries. Some vlakas respond to this knowledge by building strong communities that can last as long as possible on their home world, but others travel among the stars seeking a longer-term solution.<br><br>Vlaka fur is usually white with large patches of pale blue, gray, or black, and it provides them protection against all but the most bitter cold. Around twothirds of vlakas are born blind or deaf. Although they have long had access to magic and technology that can mitigate or remove such conditions, not all vlakas choose to do so, valuing the cultural touchstones such as language and perspective variances that are associated with differing ways of sensing the world. A typical vlaka stands 5-1/2 to 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs between 175 and 250 lbs.<br><br>Vlakas can appear unnervingly serious, but they’re acutely attuned to the emotional state of others, and they offer friendly encouragement when they sense it might be helpful. Vlakas emphasize on the well-being of the group over the individual, a practice that evolved from survival strategies required to thrive in the tundra of Lajok. While not wholly self-sacrificing, vlakas go to great lengths to assist, protect, and encourage their friends, colleagues, and kin. Vlakas frown upon self-aggrandizing leadership, and they respect those who display wisdom, listen the most, and speak the least.<br><br>Most vlaka groups are led by councils whose members rotate between roles and dutifully carry out the will of their constituents rather than seeking political power for themselves. Vlakas who travel with other races often find themselves thrust into leadership positions thanks to their penchant for working for the benefit of and listening to their allies. Most vlakas accept such responsibilities but deflect any unwarranted respect afforded them solely due to their title.<br><br>A few vlakas who visited the Pact Worlds before the Absalom Pact was signed served as a bridge between Eox and other worlds. Vlakas have since become famous as dependable go-betweens for groups seeking genuine accord. A vlaka might even work with clients who have been bad actors in the past, hoping to find a situation beneficial to all sides and to see ethical improvement in future behavior.<br><br>Many sapient creatures find themselves drawn to the camaraderie vlakas offer, but others try to take advantage of their openness. Vlakas who grow weary of the strife among other races might withdraw to focus on working with animals or machines. However, most vlakas seek well-intentioned groups of like-minded starfarers to do some good in a galaxy that can be callous and brutal.</span></p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Lajok)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or pack (3-5)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"humanoid (vlaka)","environment":"","cr":6,"xp":{"value":2400},"source":"AA 2 (p 134)","raceAndGrafts":"Vlake envoy","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":12,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":13,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":18,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":12,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":7,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":18,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":13,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":13,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":18,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":7,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"medium","senses":"blinded, blindsight (hearing) 60 ft, blindsight (scent) 30 ft","languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":"Vlakan (spoken, signed, and tactile)"},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[{"cold":"5"}],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{"sfrpg":{"conditions":[]}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Vlaka Tracker","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"dwCL6auURqLipVqV","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"gPFtlQL73LStg7ig","flags":{},"name":"Buoy (Ex)","type":"feat","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"As a standard action, a vlaka can spend 1 Resolve Point to restore 1 RP to an ally within 30 feet.

Sazarons are large creatures with a lower body similar to an iguanodon, with two thick hind legs and two leaner front legs. Generally measuring 15 feet long and weighing 900 pounds, sazarons have long tails tipped with a large knob of bone that they can wield offensively. Starting at the saurian shoulders, the sazaron’s body transitions into the torso of a large humanoid. Their incredibly thick skin gives them electricity resistance, which is helpful in the weeks that their moon plunges into the electrically charged atmosphere of Liavara—and also insulates them from dirindis’ electric greetings.<br><br>Sazarons are scholarly creatures that move at a more measured pace than most other inhabitants of Arkanen, preferring to avoid conflict in order to study and further their knowledge. Instinctively skeptical, sazarons also have the ability to magically compel others to speak only the truth.<br><br>The ancient sazaron capital of Telataranas contains numerous magical universities and mystical academies, and a great number of sazaron sages, scholars, and scientists call the city home. These scholars are particularly interested in two fields of study. Those who study atmospheric submergence analyze phenomena related to Arkanen’s annual journey through of Liavara’s atmosphere, including its effects on their moon’s ecosystems and how best to store and ration the electricity collected by the gigantic pylons interspersed throughout the capital. These scholars often find themselves working alongside their electrically attuned dirindi fellows, while many of the less academically inclined are employed as part of the corps of electricians who maintain the pillars and energy reserves.<br><br>The other most popular topic of study focuses on the mind-searing hallajins, which Arkanen is tasked with containing on the nearby moon of Hallas via a magical barrier. Many of the sazarons who are passionate about this subject either have worked to become official Pact World overseers of the mysterious species, or work closely with those overseers to make sure that the dangerous psychic energy of Hallas does not escape. Despite their desire to learn more about the hallajins and their abilities, sazarons rigidly uphold the strict rules that prohibit attempts to sneak onto Hallas— though they are more than happy to confiscate and analyze any artifacts or data that any lawbreakers might obtain.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any

These creatures resemble monstrous lizards with sharp-toothed maws, nonfunctional wings, and strong tentacles in place of legs, which they use to grab prey. They stand up to 10 feet tall and weigh up to 500 pounds.<br><br>Skreesires typically live solitary lives on rocky planetoids. The beasts are fiercely protective of their territories, even from other skreesires. They view any intrusion from a sentient creature as a threat, and thus they often use their infamous mental abilities to twist intruders’ minds and cause those creatures to flee. If that fails, they descend on the trespasser with teeth and tentacles.<br><br>Skreesires are hermaphroditic and can self-fertilize, though they usually do so only after particularly large feasts, when they have the energy required to do so. They tend to lay their clutches of eggs in the corpses of the creatures they have just fed upon, but they use soft sand or tangles of vines if needed.<br><br>The brutal and shrewd skreelings are the immature offspring of skreesires that have not yet developed the full mental abilities of their progenitors. Skreeling siblings hunt in packs, combining their nascent fighting abilities to take down foes, and they are much stronger when they work together. Skreeling hosts, as xenobiologists call these packs, often live in rocky nooks and crannies or caves where they can better protect themselves from threats until they reach adulthood. Although they lack telepathy and the physical characteristics that would allow them to speak, skreelings can emit shrill, distinctive battle cries, often to distract prey or frighten predators away from their lairs.<br><br>Skreelings almost always lair within 100 yards or so of a parent skreesire’s territory. Skreelings are omnivorous and even ingest ash, metal shavings, or wood when regular food is scarce. Once the vicious creatures reach adulthood, their expanded intellects combined with their burgeoning appetites for territory often see siblings turn on each other until the host eventually disperses and the individual skreelings search for new lairs.<br><br>Skreelings typically are about 3 feet tall, weigh about 30 pounds, and have a wingspan of about 3-1/2 feet. As the creatures grow larger and mature into full-grown skreesires, they outgrow their wings—losing their ability to fly—and their lower legs atrophy and drop off, their tails developing into multiple ambulatory tentacles. This is a very gradual process that begins the moment they are born.<br><br>Occasionally, a skreeling becomes stunted in its development, growing too large to fly but not yet having a skreesire’s psychic faculties. These mutants—known as “skreemules”—are often killed by their siblings, but they sometimes escape to live solitary lives, crawling through the hills on their malformed tentacles and snapping at any potential prey.<br><br>Though uncommon, skreeling infestations near settlements are treated more like natural hazards to be avoided than pests to be eliminated. Some residents even derive a kind of pride from these annoyances, going so far as to name geological features of the area or local businesses after the creatures. These citizens make sure to warn travelers and newcomers about the skreeling lairs, as much to keep the flying aberrations safe as the people they caution. However, such settlements are quick to curtail the skreelings should they get violent, and they hold no such love for their far more dangerous adult forms.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any hills or mountains</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>pair, trio, or host

Time breaks all things down, as all creation marches inexorably toward chaos and oblivion.<br><br>Many eons ago, a long-vanished civilization took offense to this cosmic truth and conceived of an all-purpose gel—equal parts magic and nanotechnology—that could repair nearly anything, including flesh. At some point in that civilization’s history, perhaps due to some industrial accident, a vat of this gel gained a limited sentience and began to reproduce in dark corners and sewers.<br><br>Despite all their advanced technology, the civilization eventually collapsed—perhaps even as a result of being overrun by their own creation—but the sentient gel survived, hitching rides on the hulls and in the cramped cargo bays of their progenitor race’s scattering survivors. Released onto other worlds, the gel continued to evolve and adapt, becoming the scrounging, hoarding blobs of protoplasm now generally referred to as scavenger slimes. These oozes now lurk in ruins across the galaxy, gluing together elaborate, snaillike shells for themselves from detritus and jury-rigging whatever technology they find into half-functioning weaponry.<br><br>Scavenger slimes are lumps of protoplasm measuring about 6 feet across. Though mindless, they have an intuitive understanding of order and technological systems, allowing them to patch or repair nearly anything they encounter, though rarely into a form as reliable or attractive as it may have once been. Actually using these items is often beyond them— an ooze might rebuild a hovercar, but have no idea how to operate it, unable to even grasp its purpose. Similarly, an ooze might repair a datapad, yet have no concept what the sights and sounds it displays are attempting to communicate. The sole exception to this principle is weapons: through whatever mechanism, scavenger slimes long ago gained the ability to direct and trigger the weapons they rebuild, instinctively understanding what they’re for and how to use them in their own defense, treating them like specially adapted limbs.<br><br>The key to a scavenger slime’s survival mechanisms is the dense resin it secretes, which it uses to bind pieces together or form rudimentary tools on its pseudopods. Scavenger slimes can even vary the conductivity of this resin, allowing them to patch and repair technology. This ability contributes to the scavenger slime’s most iconic feature: durable, snaillike shells each creature fashions from whatever trash it encounters. How these mindless creatures select and shape the components of their shells remains a mystery, but each supports a sophisticated and uniquely evolved life-support system that protects the ooze from vacuum. Most scavenger slimes also incorporate various kitbashed weapons into their shells, making them formidable opponents to even well-equipped adventurers.<br><br>Scavenger oozes are the bane of adventurers and treasure hunters exploring ancient ruins and abandoned space stations. Heavily armored and armed, they defend garbage heaps and treasure troves with ferocity, and whatever priceless technology they uncover is quickly disassembled and glued into their shells or incorporated into new weapons.<br><br>Their hundreds of eggs—each barely the size of a grain of rice—cling to clothing and boots, allowing them to easily spread to new environments or even starships, where they quietly grow in dark crevices, causing random system failures until the young slimes begin tearing into ship’s vital components. Despite the danger scavenger slimes pose, some creatures find them endlessly delightful. Gremlins find kinship in their destructive nature, while space goblins share the slimes’ habitats and gift for rebuilding technology. Some pirate crews have also learned to seed long-haul freighters with scavenger slime eggs, then follow from a safe distance until the oozes shut down their victims’ defenses.<br><br>While the vast majority of scavenger slimes tear down and rebuild technology, a small variant population exists that instead tears down organic beings to “maintain” them. These rare gene-scavenger slimes construct semiliving shells from bones, hide, and organs of whatever creatures they encounter, incorporating strange special abilities from various aliens and monsters. These advanced scavenger slimes demonstrate a far wider range of special abilities than their technologically inclined kin, and they engage trespassers with horrifying enthusiasm, dragging living victims away to break down—sometimes while still conscious—into new parts for their macabre armor.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Scavenger Slime Grenades</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">The scavenger slime’s sticky resin can be used as makeshift stickybomb grenades (<em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> 178). A slain scavenger slime, when properly harvested in treated glass vessels, yields up to 20 item levels’ worth of stickybomb grenades—so 2 stickybomb grenades III (each level 10), or 5 stickybomb grenades II (each level 4), and so on. Harvesting the slime in this manner requires a DC 28 Engineering or Life Science check—success means you acquire all the desired stickybombs, while failure deals 2d10+13 bludgeoning damage to you as the slime revitalizes just long enough to attack you. This check can be attempted only once per scavenger slime corpse.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\"></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Slime-Patch Systems</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">While most spacefarers know better than to try and harness scavenger slimes’ technology, given the obvious dangers involved, the oozes’ ability to quickly adapt and repair systems has made them surprisingly useful tools for those starship engineers daring enough to employ them. Slime-patch systems can be installed in any starship for 8 Build Points, with no expansion bay or PCU cost. When a ship with slime-patch systems acquires a critical damage condition, the slime-patch system automatically turns on, spraying the damaged systems with scavenger slime material almost like a fire-sprinkler system. The slime, which is chemically treated to die within moments of its unexpected freedom, automatically begins repairing the system, reducing the number of engineering actions required to patch the critical damage condition by 1 (minimum 1).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or work crew (3-10)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Ooze","environment":"","cr":9,"xp":{"value":6400},"source":"AA pg. 100","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":17,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":22,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"large","senses":"blindsight (vibration) 60 ft., sightless","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":"Ooze Immunities"},"dr":{"value":[{"fire":"10"}],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":"Ooze Immunities"},"damageReduction":{"value":5,"negatedBy":"adamantine"},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Scavenger Slime","displayName":40,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":60,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"5HDlxkTb5P7ei9kT","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"flags":{},"name":"Scavenger Shell (Ex)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"Scavenger slimes build protective shells for themselves out of refuse and their own natural resin, incorporating bits of repaired technology as they go.

While many carbon-based life-forms from other Pact Worlds have since settled there, mining valuable crystals and hunting the silicon predators for their biologically produced superconductors, the world’s crystalline forests and faceted plateaus have also produced their own intelligent races, most notably the famed urogs.<br/><br/>Urog anatomy can be deceptive. When encountered in their everyday or “traveling mode,” they almost resemble crystalline slugs or snails, their shimmering shell-scales hanging down almost to the ground and hiding their limbs as they float along like hovercrafts on a thin cushion of electromagnetism produced by microscopic cilia. It’s only when they’re in “engagement mode”-whether that means mating, fighting, or interacting directly with other races or their environment-that they rear up and unfold their multiple sets of articulated limbs. While every urog has a powerful beak adorning its head-stalk, this is used solely for fighting and reproduction. Food consumption actually occurs underneath an urog, as it uses the localized electromagnetic effects of its cilia to gradually break molecular bonds and tear tiny pieces off whatever it’s consuming. These “bites” are so microscopic that it’s often hard for other races to even tell what’s happening, with the item in question simply eroding steadily without any obvious markings. Though this allows urogs to eat nearly anything, breaking off and absorbing only the molecules they need and leaving aside the ones they don’t, they prefer the silicon-based plant life of their home. This peculiar method of absorbing nutrients also makes them nearly impossible to poison or drug, as their bodies simply discard any unnecessary ingested molecules.<br/><br/>With plenty of options for food and few predators thanks to their size and sturdy frames, urogs are free to spend most of their time in contemplation. Constantly inspired by the complex geometry of their crystalline world, they wander seemingly at random across the moon’s surface, alone or in loose coalitions, working on mathematical problems or conducting enigmatic experiments. Their languid pace belies their exceedingly sharp intellect; indeed, it is likely because of their laser-like focus on unlocking the galaxy’s most esoteric mathematical and scientific secrets that they can be somewhat slow to react to external stimuli.<br/><br/>Urogs often become single minded in finding the most efficient solution to a problem, spending untold hours just to shave seconds off a given process. This reputation for exactitude has made the crystalline creatures sought-after astrogators, consultants, engineers, and scientists in the Pact Worlds, though most members of other races who work with them acknowledge that such relationships can be challenging, to put it mildly. Though largely friendly- at least by their own standards-urogs are creatures with little appreciation for social niceties. A bored urog will think nothing of tuning out the person speaking to them or even wandering away entirely, regardless of how powerful the speaker may be, or how potentially life-threatening the matter they’re discussing. Even those who do prove themselves worthy of an urog’s attention must still deal with its brusque personality. Urog emotions are difficult for most other creatures to understand, and resolve primarily around the satisfaction of solving a problem, disappointment at failure, or the excitement of a promising line of inquiry. As such, urogs readily point out mistakes, whether their own or others’. While this is in the interest of improving performance and achieving better results, few humans have the patience and poise to graciously accept an enthusiastic urog’s stream of constant criticism.<br/><br/>Urogs who choose lives of adventure often do so because they believe mathematical and scientific secrets hide in pockets of the galaxy that simply can’t be observed from their limited vantage point on a small moon-and often because they distrust the rigor of the scholarship produced by other species. Urogs who leave Dykon for long periods sometimes suffer an attenuation of their race’s special abilities, likely due to their changed diet and lack of certain electrical fields normally provided by the moon itself. Most successful spacefaring urogs eventually see the value in assisting their less deliberate companions, and they make excellent engineers and science officers on ships that have enough room for the large creatures and their overbearing personas.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>warm hills and mountains

This mobile mold creeps its way through even the narrowest of crevices to infest a building and slowly digests all the organic matter within, whether discarded food, flesh, or wood. A writher swarm leaves behind only ceramic, concrete, metal, plastic, and stone, making them less of a threat in large urban centers where structures are largely composed of such materials, but potentially devastating to less advanced settlements.<br><br>A single spore of a writher swarm can lie dormant for as long as several centuries, whether as a passenger on a meteor or in a cavern deep below the ground. Under the right conditions, that spore can attach to a modicum of organic material, such as a stale piece of bread or the rotting corpse of a tiny animal, after which it quickly begins growing and multiplying. If it is not eradicated, a writher swarm becomes fully mobile in a matter of weeks and can start to seek out new sources of nourishment. Even if a writher swarm presence is discovered before this point and thoroughly scoured, it’s likely that several spores will survive undetected, possibly hitching rides to new environs.<br><br>Though a writher swarm’s tiny filaments can pierce hide and flesh, the true danger comes from the infectious particles it can implant in the wounds of its prey. These infestations grow at a rapid rate just under the victim’s skin, draining the creature’s vitality, forcing it into a coma, and eventually killing it. Unless the unfortunate victim is treated before it dies, it becomes host to a new writher swarm, which tears its way out through the creature’s skin after it dies.<br><br>When a writher swarm infests a structure for several decades-getting enough food to sustain it but not causing so much death as to draw attention to itself-it grows long, rootlike filaments that thread through the floors, ceilings, and walls. This allows the plant to surround itself with a kind of organic security system that alerts it as soon as new prey sets foot in its domain. However, this fungal framework can eventually supplant the building’s own structural supports, and when such a writher swarm dies and its network of filaments turns to dust, the surrounding building often collapses soon afterward.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any temperate or warm

A planetwide disaster millions of years ago split the common ancestor of both species into two populations. One population remained on the planet’s devastated surface and evolved into the skittermanders. The other population retreated into the planet’s extensive cave system, becoming larger, faster, and increasingly vicious as they competed for dwindling food supplies. Eventually, the stridermanders reemerged on the surface and the two populations met once again—and the skittermanders became prey.<br><br>Called strovion by the vesk, which roughly translates as “skittering wolves,” stridermanders are brawny and threatening. Like most natives of Vesk-3, they have eight limbs, four of which are long and graceful, capable of running at high speeds and climbing through the rocky caverns where the creatures make their nests. The four shorter arms are more muscular and used for restraining prey, mating, and manipulating their environment. Their most identifiable feature is a feeding tendril that emerges from their abdomen— similar to that of a skittermander whelp—which is long enough and strong enough to drag a grown human through the darkness or lift a vesk soldier into the air.<br><br>Stridermanders feed by restraining their victims and puncturing their flesh, draining their fluids first so the rest of the body can be eaten more slowly over time. They prefer preying on skittermanders but will attack and devour anything their own size or smaller, as the vesk have discovered.<br><br>While simpleminded and animalistic, stridermanders are clever predators and construct simple obsidian tools. They have no language but hunt using coordinated pack tactics. Even more terrifying, skittermander legends speak of stridermander tyrants—larger, more vicious mutants with uncanny abilities to cloud people’s minds and fool the senses.<br><br>Today, stridermanders remain a danger in Vesk-3’s deep forests and caverns, though the Veskarium has heavily curtailed their numbers. Their whelps are small, rodent-like, and solitary, making them difficult to exterminate and allowing them to easily stow away on starships. Stridermanders have consequently migrated to several other worlds, where they reproduce quickly and fill apex predator roles in wilderness and ruins environments.

They communicate empathically with their hosts, while a rare few are also sentient and able to speak with—and even overwhelm—their hosts.

The template grafts below can be used to create a creature bonded to a symbiend; at the GM’s discretion, a PC can also bond with a symbiend, ignoring the array requirements and suggested ability score modifiers. A symbiend counts as an augmentation that is “installed” in the listed systems, though a removed symbiend can be used by another creature (unlike normal augmentations).

As creatures with no motivations of their own, undead minions can also be found leaderless in the remains of ruined structures on planetary surfaces, adrift in derelict spacecraft, and even floating through the void of space. Whether encountered as servants of a mastermind who coordinates their movements or as a mindless threat in the wake of a cataclysmic disaster, undead minions are always a force to be reckoned with and a scourge to the living.<br><br>Though there are countless types of mindless undead who serve as minions, the most common are cybernetic zombies, occult zombies, and skeletal undead. Both occult zombies and skeletal undead are animated by magical or supernatural forces and created either in dark necromantic rituals (including the&nbsp;create undead&nbsp;spell) or by strange and mysterious reactions between the Material and Negative Energy Planes. Cybernetic zombies, on the other hand, arise as the result of technological implants that continue to function after their hosts have died, causing the body to act in a sad, shambling imitation of real life. Without control from an external force, these three kinds of undead simply go through the motions of their former lives, without reason, purpose, or the promise of an end to their miserable existences.<br><br>In the Pact Worlds, most undead hail from the dead world of Eox and were created by the bone sages, though zombies and skeletal creatures are also found among the wreckage of ancient battlefields on Akiton and the enigmatic, alien structures on Aucturn. In contrast, cybernetic zombies are most often found on worlds with high levels of technological development, such as Aballon, Castrovel, and Verces.<br><br>Those cultists of Urgathoa who see undeath as the pinnacle of being surround themselves with undead minions, both to use their abilities to terrorize innocent folk and to study their physiology in order to become undead themselves. While these worshipers would prefer to become more intelligent undead creatures, they often find that their fate is to rise up as a skeleton or zombie. Priests of Pharasma, on the other hand, often go out of their way to destroy all undead creatures, especially their mindless minions.<br><br>Undead minions can be formed from the corpses of any type of creature, though most of those appearing in folklore from across the galaxy are animated versions of whatever culture is telling the tale. Humanoids tell of ambulatory corpses rising from their ritual burial grounds, while aberrations, dragons, and magical beasts have their own legends of mindless dead of their own species returning to plague the living. Whatever the undead creatures’ original form, they often maintain natural attacks and other physical characteristics of their living counterparts even in undeath, though their mindless nature means they lose the ability to carry out complex tactics, conduct intricate or detailed tasks, and cast spells or take other mentally engaging actions. Yet the creatures’ mindlessness makes them all the more frightening and threatening, as they can be neither reasoned with nor cowed.<br><br>Use the following template grafts to create other versions

The wetzelt is a hunter and tracker, able to swiftly follow prey. The creature also generates an electromagnetic field that jams comm units and causes other powered items to fail on discharge.<br /><br />Wetzelts are strange in appearance. They possess four appendages like a humanoid, but they crawl on all fours, and their limbs project out from the side. As a result, the wetzelt looks like it is walking on four arms, elbows sticking out. The wetzelt has scaly skin, glowing eyes, and a bulbous head with a beak-like mouth and no visible ears or nose.<br /><br />The horrifying truth about the wetzelt is that they are not merely organisms grown in a lab. Each was once a reptoid, before being subjected to extensive biological manipulation. Although non-reptoid scholars theorize that this form is a punishment reserved for reptoids who have betrayed their kind-perhaps by revealing reptoid secrets or simply abandoning their assignment to live within their new society, as many reptoids have been known to do-no one in the Pact Worlds knows for sure why some reptoids are transformed. If reversing the transformation is possible, no one has yet discovered a reliable method.<br /><br />Wetzelts left on their own hunt whatever prey they can find. Their claws are engineered to shred through hard material, so they freely ambush both solitary victims and vehicles with potential prey inside.<br /><br />Site Owner: Blake DavisEmail Spam Checker: MX Guarddog</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary or pair</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Aberration (reptoid)","environment":"","cr":4,"xp":{"value":1200},"source":"AP #27 (p 61)","subtype":"Reptoid","aura":"Electromagnetic Field - 30 Ft.

Now referred to as umbracygots, these beasts enter vicious frenzies when other species stumble into their domains, looking to consume the interlopers. While relentless in their attempts to feed, umbracygots rarely pursue intruders beyond the borders of their territories to better conserve energy in an environment with limited nutrition.<br/><br/>When not feeding, an umbracygot enters a trancelike hibernation during which it constantly burrows in circles and strange patterns beneath the surface with endless, unthinking repetition. Some xenobiologists speculate that the patterns an umbracygot creates within the territory it inhabits indicate the creature’s mood or even their psychic impressions on the cosmos. Unfortunately, not enough data has been collected on these designs because an umbracygot awakens from its trance to attack when it senses a trespasser.<br/><br/>A typical adult umbracygot is 16 feet long and weighs 1,500 pounds. These creatures possess more intelligence than their monstrous appearances would suggest, but conversations with them are rare. Umbracygots usually socialize on the rare occasions when they’re full and don’t wish to exert energy on a wasteful meal, or when they’re mating. The knowledge gleaned from these unique interactions has proven useful in understanding their psychology, though their main concerns are defending their territory and consuming.<br/><br/>Site Owner: Blake DavisEmail Spam Checker: MX Guarddog</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (terrestrial vacuum)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or clutch (3-6)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","public":""},"type":"Aberration","environment":"","cr":12,"xp":{"value":19200},"source":"AP #31 (p 61)","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":22,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":27,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":27,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":22,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"large","senses":"blindsense (vibration) 60 ft., darkvision 60 ft.","languages":{"value":["aklo"],"custom":"Telepathy 60 ft."},"di":{"value":["acid","cold"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":["sonic"],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"damageReduction":{"value":10,"negatedBy":"-"},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{"sfrpg":{"conditions":[]}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Umbracygot","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"fqRJzY1FMD9vsCvh","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"RUrspSXVvMLL5mTo","flags":{},"name":"Void Adaptation","type":"feat","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>(EX OR SU)</p>\n<p>Numerous creatures are inured to the void of outer space.

This plant creature is exceedingly rare, and the lack of information about its biology allows it to surprise oblivious explorers. When a suitably large living creature wanders nearby, a void palm plunges the area around it into magical darkness while simultaneously interrupting gravity’s normal function. Creatures caught in this area might become unable to propel themselves out of range of the void palm’s lashing fronds-something the plant deliberately makes more difficult by using its leaves to sweep the area around it clear of debris that might be used as handholds or counterbalance.<br><br>Though they are rare, void palms are found across the galaxy. Their unique method of reproduction lends itself well to a slow but inexorable colonization of the stars. Once a year, a void palm produces a brilliant blue seed at the end of each of its stalks over the course of a week, and then it flings its progeny into the sky. The remarkable seeds each carry the void palm’s supernatural ability to ignore gravity, allowing the momentum imparted from their parent to carry them off the void palm’s planet and onto new ones. This unique ability makes void palm seeds rare and expensive curios.<br><br>The typical void palm is 15 feet tall and weighs around 1,000 pounds.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any land</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Plant","environment":"","cr":7,"xp":{"value":3200},"source":"AP #8 (p 60)","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":19,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":19,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":14,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":14,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":19,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"large","senses":"darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":"Plant Immunities"},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":"Plant Immunities"},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{"sfrpg":{"conditions":[]}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Void Palm","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"xnlXzr2OUkL9Paj0","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"0fD99wf4LZ5YPqMj","flags":{},"name":"Void Fronds (Su)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>When seen in black and white, such as with darkvision in darkness, the pattern on a void palm fronds resembles a dim and distant field of stars.

Appearing as a member of the local humanoid populace, these charismatic creatures have little difficulty making fast friends and even faster rivals with their quick wit and flippant attitudes. As consummate rabble-rousers, they inevitably cause trouble for the communities that receive them.<br><br>The cause for the stelezorn’s aggravating tendencies lies within their unusual diet: they feed on the wrathful emotions of sapient beings. Stelezorns have a strong attunement to such emotions, absorbing the anger and frustration of nearby creatures in much the same way that plants gain nutrients from sunlight. They feed on nearby creatures, usually making passive-aggressive remarks that frustrate people around them while avoiding physical confrontation until such altercations become inevitable. Most stelezorns maintain a broad and carefully cultivated social network to keep their feeding from overtaxing any one individual, a process they refer to as “tending the garden.”<br><br>In contrast to the creatures they provoke, stelezorns endeavor to maintain composure. They see themselves as masters of their own emotions and consider themselves to be better than anyone who falls prey to their manipulations. In truth, they’re no less prone to outbursts than most humanoids. Their control places them in either stoic calm or frothing rage, but their emotions rarely see any middle ground. When threatened, a stelezorn can tap into reserves of siphoned wrath to grow into a hulking brute, but they do so only out of need, as such outbursts cause the creature to lose face among their own kind.<br><br>In their natural form, a stelezorn looks like an androgynous, green-skinned humanoid with dark hair and a pair of swept-back horns.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any urban</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or riot

Weapons and combat-oriented creatures are commonly banned. In response, arms dealers and tech-minded assassins build combat drones disguised as toys. Many of these constructs are concealed only for transport, but some integrate their innocuous appearance into their functions with the intent of fooling potential victims as much as shipping securely. Not to be overlooked is the humiliation of being attacked by a toy.<br><br>One popular design is the devil-in-a-box. A figure, scary or cute, is stuffed into a box or similar container, from which it springs when activated. The construct has serrated limbs or jaws capable of slicing through modern composites and a keen virtual intelligence programmed to identify and track targets and to maim or kill. Common “devils” range from literal fiends to skittermanders with saw-like jaws or model Swarm thresher lords. These murderous toys are common enough that modern security gives more scrutiny to them in customs and boarding processes, but telling a mere toy from a killer drone is difficult.<br><br>High-end gaming devices have been used for similar ends. Gamedroids normally function, singly or in groups, to create sophisticated holographic game environments using rechargeable banks of spell chips embedded in their onboard casting units. Installing new spell chips into a prepackaged casting unit is difficult. However, weaponized casting units can be scratch-built in a reasonable amount of time and installed into gamedroids. A shipment of gamedroids can then become a delivery of assassins, loaded with combat magic. Like other weaponized toys, these lethal constructs need only to be assigned a target. And, since off-the-shelf models can be weaponized, tracing the perpetrators can be problematic.<br><br>Laws to control weaponized toys are hard to create and enforce. Lobbyists balk at legislation that burdens manufacturers or slows shipping. Apostae’s lobbyists in particular have been vocal that laws mustn’t hold producers accountable for misuse of their goods, as the precedent would be untenable and the reach overlarge. Responsibility lies, industry advocates insist, with law enforcement and the criminals who perpetrate such abuse.</span></p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or cackle (3-8)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Construct (magical, technological)","environment":"","cr":3,"xp":{"value":800},"source":"AA 3 (p 132)","subtype":"Technological","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":13,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":8,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":8,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"tiny","senses":"darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision","languages":{"value":[],"custom":"Common (can't speak any)"},"di":{"value":[],"custom":"Construct Immunities"},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":"Vulnerable To Critical Hits"},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":"Construct Immunities"},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{"sfrpg":{"conditions":[]}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Weaponized Devil-In-A-Box","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"ohvQfaAjBHSv5tJT","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"ybcQ29VRyCdVUPk6","flags":{},"name":"Boxed (Ex)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A weaponized devil-in-a-box has an attached box with a lid.

These metropolises stand as a testament to the perseverance and resourcefulness of the planet’s most notable inhabitants: crystalline humanoids known as shimreens. Shimreens built their domes not only to protect their cities from the storms, but also to harness the abundant available energy that powers their civilization. According to surviving records, the crystalline people have been doing this since long before the Gap.<br><br>Shimreens are composed of glimmering crystal, and the average shimreen is 7 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds. Though their tall, angular bodies can be any color (or even clear), most tend toward cool, bright jewel tones such as blue, purple, or teal. Much like their radiant metropolises, shimreens glow from within.<br><br>The most popular legend about how shimreens came to be holds that the first shimreen was kissed by lightning, rising out of the earth and into sapience—and that their spark has passed down through the generations. Whatever their origins, modern shimreen are not so much born as they are made. Pharasma’s Forge, once merely a small volcanic hotspot, has developed over millennia into a sacred temple of making and unmaking. Narrow canals, carved into the mountain’s face in ray-like patterns, direct small rivers of lava into creation chambers. To form a new shimreen, fragments from one or more living parents are placed into a chamber, which is superheated by lava until either a soul is attracted to the seed crystals and a new shimreen is formed, or the contributed shards are consumed. It’s possible for a single shimreen to reproduce alone, or for each member of a large family unit to donate a piece of themselves. Since shimreens generally live for centuries, when one passes away, their body is taken in a solemn procession to be added to the lava that powers Pharasma’s Forge so that they may contribute to the making of new life. Shimreens are able to change their body slightly to fit their needs, including shifting an arm into a crystal lance or adjusting their constant internal glow. A significant number of shimreens shape the crystals atop their heads to form crowns, while others let the crystals around their faces grow wild to form clusters they call manes— and some do both.<br><br>Thanks to Shimrinsara’s endless source of energy, its citizens are employed chiefly in the pursuit of culture and trade, rather than toiling to gather resources. Two castes make up the majority of shimreen inhabitants: workers and warriors. Workers can have a variety of skilled occupations and include artisans, engineers, entertainers, and scientists. Warriors are mainly tasked with fending off attempted incursions from outsiders who covet the shimreens’ plentiful resources, though they are also skilled in hunting the wild creatures that survive unprotected in the planet’s harsh atmosphere.<br><br>The seven glowing cities of Shimrinsara are called the Jewels of Shimreen, and the largest of these is Kaniqlu, where elected representatives from each city form a council of seven that governs the planet. While most shimreens are fiercely protective of their home world, they do enjoy engaging in trade with other cultures so that they may learn and grow. During shimreen holidays, citizens gather to watch parades featuring several battalions of warriors, all performing intricate routines that are a mixture of elegant, flowing dance and ruthlessly lethal combat maneuvers.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Shimrinsara)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or cluster

An akata looks similar in shape to a lion, but with hairless, rubbery blue skin and a mane of thick, lashing tentacles. Its face is little more than two eyes glowing with ever-changing light and a fanged maw. Two long tentacular tails extend from its muscular hindquarters. A typical akata stands 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.<br/><br/>Akatas lack auditory organs, lungs, and vocal cords, and they can’t hear or vocalize in any way. Instead, they communicate with each other through sight and scent. Akatas can change the color of their eyes to over a thousand shades, which they use in conjunction with complex tail movements to communicate visually. Scent glands located just behind the jawbone on akatas’ necks produce a wide variety of smells that other akatas can “taste” with their tongues.<br/><br/>Akatas live in colonies of up to 30 individuals. Massive akatas known as akata alphas rule the largest of these colonies. Most colonies inhabit small asteroids or meteors hurtling through the depths of space. Akatas can hibernate for centuries, protecting themselves in cocoons made from a combination of resin from the creatures’ pores and noqual. When a meteorite carrying an akata colony crashes onto a planet or another astronomical object that can support life, the akatas awake from their cocoons. Akatas usually consume the remains of their cocoons upon awakening, but 1 bulk of noqual worth 500 credits can be harvested from the remnants of a single akata cocoon (see page 64 of Starfinder Armory for more information on noqual). Once awakened, akatas can drastically depopulate a planet as they seek out suitable hosts for their young.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section

Infamously, Hellknight mages cover the inside of the armor with an infernal contract, infusing the creation with a minor devilish being forced into submission. Such armors serve as decorative sentinels in Hellknight facilities or disposable shock troops on the battlefield. The Knights of Golarion and Xenowardens use similar means to infuse armor with quiescent fragments of angelic will, elementals, or nature spirits. Eoxian technomancers instead instill armor with rudimentary unlife, sometimes using the remains of undead too damaged to operate without the artificial casing armor provides.<br><br>More technologically minded factions have similarly diverse approaches to creating animated armor. Technicians at the Qabarat University of Psychic and Technological Excellence have built on the psychically charged circuits of lashunta mind mail to create a sort of hybrid robot. These suits of mind mail combine artificial intelligence with psychic potential to become animated. Other groups, such as the Android Abolitionist Front, have a fondness for animated and sapient armor. Perceptionist members of the Front claim such armors, among other advanced artificial intelligences, must be protected as created people. One such Perceptionist, a zealot named 8-Karat, has begun liberating these constructs, using violence if necessary.<br><br>On Akiton, VitariTech Industries engages in unmonitored research into animated armor. The company recently claimed a long-abandoned shrine to Triune, using heavy security forces to keep interlopers out. Rumors indicate the corporation is using what it found within the site to build advanced constructs, including robot-like troops of animated heavy armor led by suits of powered armor. Devotees of various factions faithful to the All-Code want to know what VitariTech is up to within this holy place, as do members of the Perceptionists and the Augmented.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary or pair</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Construct (magical, technological; armor)","environment":"","cr":16,"xp":{"value":76800},"source":"AA3 (pg. 6)","subtype":"Magical, Technological; Armor","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":33,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":28,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":28,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":28,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"medium","senses":"darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision","languages":{"value":["castrovelian","common"],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":"Construct Immunities"},"dr":{"value":[{"cold":"15"},{"fire":"15"}],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":"Construct Immunities"},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Animated Lashunta Mind Mail Iii","displayName":40,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":60,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"TN8FC6D1BmmqMDWa","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"flags":{},"name":"Integrated Weapons","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"The creature’s weapons are manufactured weapons, not natural weapons, and they are integrated into its frame.

Depending on their role, however, an anacite might be anything from a bulldozer-sized mining specialist to a floating electronic brain designed for advanced problem-solving, and even those anacites who fit the stereotypical metal-insect design usually have a modification or two, and almost all anacites can reconfigure parts of themselves to adapt to their circumstances.<br><br>In the uncounted millennia since the departure of the so-called “First Ones,” anacites have not been idle. The two primary factions of anacites, Those Who Wait and Those Who Become, have very different ideas of their purpose in life, yet the two are more alike than different.

These 4-foot-long machines whir from ridge to ridge on wings glittering with solar panels, feeding on the blazing light of the sun.

Those who encroach on sharpwing territory know that the only way to survive an encounter with the deadly predator is to bring it down before it draws close enough to attack with its devastating talons. Even such an undertaking is fraught with risk, as the creatures slice through the sky at such speeds that few have a chance of firing more than once or twice before the creature’s razor claws descend. Sneaking up on a sharpwing is next to impossible thanks to the sensors covering its sleek body and wings, and while the beast is flying, it almost always sees its prey long before the prey is aware of its presence.<br><br>Fortunately for other creatures, these long-ranging hunters typically fly alone. One sharpwing is a dangerous foe, with little preference in the creatures it hunts. A pair can be deadly even to an experienced adventurer, especially if the creatures happen to be defending a nest or a newly hatched keenling, and woe unto the foolish explorer who stumbles the creatures roosting along the edges of an Ice Well crater. Only in lean times will the creatures take to the sky as a group to hunt, but when they do, they have been known to bring down prey several times their size.<br><br>Sharpwing breeding season lasts for several months each year, during which an unpaired male sharpwing’s many visual sensors begin to blink rapidly. Biologists believe that this fast blinking signals to unpaired female sharpwings that the male’s sensors are strong and plentiful. In areas where the male sharpwing population is greater than the female population, multiple unpaired males sometimes gather in a circle around a female and spread their wings, trying to showcase as many of their sensors as possible. The female sharpwing then chooses a suitable mate from among the suitors by pecking sharply at his forehead. A sharpwing lays only three or four eggs at a time, and the parents remain paired until all the eggs have hatched, as they both have connections to them after they are laid.<br><br>Sharpwing eggs are covered with the same organs that cover a sharpwing’s body, and sharpwing parents have the curious ability to see through those eyes. Many scholars believe this connection is possible due to a genetic form of quantum entanglement the creatures evolved thanks to Aballon’s natural radiation. Others posit that the First Ones are responsible for tinkering with the species’ genetic code millennia ago. In addition, and slightly more puzzling to biologists, is the eggs’ ability to sprout slender legs and flee threats perceived through these same sensors. Such movement is of questionable evolutionary benefit, as it is neither swift nor stealthy and has been known to result in the eggs tumbling down cliffs, sinking into bodies of water, or otherwise ensuring their own destruction.<br><br>Sharpwings’ unusual biology provides multitudinous opportunities in arcane, biogenetic, and technological research and development, but it has led to overeager researchers turning to or becoming game hunters. Paying to acquire a sharpwing or one of their eggs is a costly endeavor, and even more so for living specimens. Some entrepreneurs have captured sharpwings to breed them as a commodity, leading to out-of-control invasive populations of the predators on planets far from Aballon. However, they are on the brink of extinction on their home world due to this same increasing demand and the planet’s ever-expanding urban sprawl. This threat to the species (and the threat sharpwings pose to species on other worlds) has drawn the attention of the Xenowardens, and discussion of trade sanctions now threatens to push the breeding, capture, and trade of sharpwings and their eggs into the black market, where it will undoubtedly flourish and possibly hasten the species’ demise.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ocucloaks</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">For centuries, military organizations have striven to give their fighters the same type of battlefield awareness granted by a sharpwing’s many eyes. In the past, certain arcane scholars have re-created this ability with unstable magic, sometimes with unfortunate (and grotesque) consequences. Early tests with clothing studded with nanocameras linked to a pair of bulky goggles left most users disoriented and queasy. More recent studies of sharpwing egg anatomy and advances in modern biotechnology have enabled the creation of an organic microprocessor that attaches to the user’s occipital lobe, giving her the ability to interpret visual signals generated by sensors woven into a piece of clothing known to many manufacturers as an ocucloak. The most popular models of the following biotechnological augmentation (<em>Starfinder Core Rulebook</em> 208) and the attached garment are produced by Brethedan companies.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any cold (Aballon)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or sight

When the source of their power dwindled, the shatoris searched the planes for more eldritch energy. Their overreach led them to Abaddon, and when they retreated from that plane, an army of daemons followed them back to the Disaj system.<br><br>The daemons overwhelmed the defenses of Perdane, destroying civilization and the environment there. As the forces of Abaddon spread, the shatoris withdrew to Perdure, another world in their system, to plan. They knew their doom was a matter of time, so they hastily enacted a complex ritual that opened a demiplane to allow some of them to enter stasis for centuries. The complex spell was too rushed, though, and the survivors ended up in a pocket dimension connected to Pharasma’s Boneyard, where the shatoris slept for ages. As they did, the Boneyard’s energies altered them.<br><br>When their spell released them, the remaining shatoris were changed. They each retained great height and grace, but their flesh had become semitransparent and their bones limned with light. This combination makes shatoris’ eyes glow and their bones visible through their translucent flesh. Shatoris are living creatures, but centuries of exposure to the energies of the Boneyard have have extended each shatori’s natural life indefinitely and rendered them sterile.<br><br>The shatoris returned to Perdure a shattered people. They had witnessed their species’ near extinction and their civilization’s ruin. All their previous accomplishments had been razed to ruins, and their future seems to be one of slow attrition. Despair gripped survivors in the early days after their return. The wisest shatoris could see that their people’s despondency might accomplish what the daemons could not. Nine of these shatoris, called the Shabani, drafted a document called the Shaban, laying out ideal behavior and enshrining a culture of impartiality and tranquility, placing the objective over the subjective. The Shaban endorses detachment from the material world and rejects the worship of gods. It instead recommends philosophical egoism that leans toward benevolent self-interest, which includes working to benefit others, seeing the common good as an extension of personal welfare. Based on the Shaban, shatoris believe they should each find a purpose and use their gifts to fulfill that reason for existing, profiting themselves and others. According to the Shaban, inaction is the greatest sin—a wasted life dishonors the billions of shatoris who were denied the chance to live at all.<br><br>Shatoris see each death among them as a potentially catastrophic loss. Therefore, they seek to ensure their personal knowledge and culture is remembered even if they fail to survive, keeping detailed records. Shatoris also distribute their knowledge with little restraint, including to other sapient species.<br><br>When the Signal provided Drift travel to the shatoris, they had already expanded to Prevail, another world relatively untouched by the daemons in the Disaj system. Despite exploring Drift travel in theory, they remained in Disaj. When the Azlanti arrived in the Disaj system, the shatoris headed off conflict by offering their services as analysts, scholars, and magic‑users. The Disaj system became a vassal of the Azlanti Star Empire with no struggle. Shatoris serve the Azlanti with quiet obedience, fearing for their species’ survival. Still, some brave shatoris act subtly against the empire. As highly skilled servants, shatoris conduct research and fill bureaucratic roles essential to the empire’s stability and expansion. Many of these privileged positions allow shatoris to influence the course of the empire’s policy and future, and the stoic immortals hope the long-term impact of their actions changes the empire for the better of all.<br><br>The combination of shatori philosophy, dread of extinction, and desire for remembrance makes many averse to risk. Such shatoris remain in imperial space, hunting for ways to alter their fate. A few shatoris, however, are bold enough to take greater risks and travel the galaxy in search of answers and new possibilities.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Perdure)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, team (2-5), or convention (6-11)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Humanoid","environment":"","cr":4,"xp":{"value":1200},"source":"AA3 pg. 94","subtype":"Shatori","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":15,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":10,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":10,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":10,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":10,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"medium","senses":"","languages":{"value":["azlanti"],"custom":"Perani"},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":"6","max":"6"},"spell2":{"value":"3","max":"3"},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Shatori Analyst","displayName":40,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"CsC6Di0dQxxhvcX6","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"flags":{},"name":"Dueling sword, tactical","type":"weapon","img":"systems/sfrpg/icons/equipment/weapons/dueling-sword.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>While dueling swords are crafted to be aesthetically pleasing and are often seen as a mark of rank or tradition, many warriors still train with them to deadly effect.

These outsiders are constantly cheerful, frequently playing pranks and making jokes, but their good humor belies a great deal of power. Tritidairs have a deep connection to the nuclear fusion that powers stars, giving them their star-related abilities. Their eyes twinkle with starlight that can fascinate some viewers, so they keep their eyes covered with stylish goggles to prevent accidental exposure. Travelers in starships occasionally spot the unmistakable purple streak of light as a tritidair flies past.<br/><br/>Tritidairs are devoted servants of Desna and frequently travel to Cynosure, the pole star and home of Desna’s palace. Desnan priests say that the goddess planted a seed in a new star, which shot forth light that became the first tritidair. Although this origin story might be apocryphal, what is certain is that the birth of every new star creates a tritidair. They don’t remain near their stars of origin for long, but each tritidair has a unique pattern of glowing dots on their butterfly wings corresponding to the locations of the stars where and when they were born.<br/><br/>These outsiders serve as messengers and pages for the Song of the Spheres, running errands for her throughout the galaxy. Although their starlight form enables interplanar travel, this method of travel has its limits. Tritidairs explain that not every star can provide passage-some are broken-but the concept is difficult to describe to others. Still, tritidairs can move quickly over vast distances to convey messages or provide aid to followers and allies of Desna who find themselves in trouble.<br/><br/>Tritidairs are fiercely loyal. The kindhearted and impulsive creatures don’t seek out combat, nor does Desna commonly send them on missions involving violence. If pushed into combat, particularly if required to protect innocents, they are very willing to use spells and weapons to deal deadly damage. All tritidairs carry easily identifiable starknives patterned with constellations matching those on their wings. These magical starknives charge with energy each time the tritidair travels between stars. Many Desnans carry copies of these knives. Some who have interacted with a tritidair engrave such starknives with constellation patterns matching the wings of that tritidair as a way to honor and remember the azata, much like carving a dear friend’s name on a personal treasure.<br/><br/>These azatas lack sexual characteristics, but some tritidairs choose a gender, and many favor the feminine, mimicking their goddess. They enjoy art, music, and theater, and it’s not uncommon for a major performance to have a tritidair or two in attendance. When tritidairs meet in larger groups, they often enjoy playing games and sports. However, tritidairs don’t have permanent residences or family units, and they don’t stay in one place for long.<br/><br/>Tritidairs sometimes linger on Cynosure or in Elysium, but most prefer to remain on the Material Plane. They genuinely enjoy the company of mortals, and when not on assignments from Desna, tritidairs travel, alone or in small groups, to random planets or starships, where the azatas look for new friends and adventures. Because of this tritidair spirit of exploration, many species on various worlds have myths and stories of flying star children.<br/><br/>Although tritidairs spread the worship of Desna, their primary motivations are to meet new creatures and have fun experiences. They aren’t the most reliable when called upon by anyone but Desna, but nevertheless, some creatures and organizations successfully form alliances with tritidairs. Solarians and tritidairs can feel a connection to one another, given their mutual association with the stars.<br/><br/>Tritidairs don’t age, and some have outlived the birth and death of stars. A tritidair can survive the destruction of its star of origin, and similarly the demise of a tritidair has no discernible effect on the star. Tritidairs also don’t require sleep, but they engage in long meditations to dream. Not only do they find the experience amusing, but Desna can also speak with them through their dreams, sending the tritidairs their missions.<br/><br/>Other creatures sleeping or engaging in similar deep rest near a meditating tritidair can find their dreams invaded by vivid visions from the azatas. Many who have such experiences report that their dreams never go back to normal, remaining rich and dramatic, but seldom troubling. Worshipers of Desna sometimes seek out tritidairs, hoping to earn this experience.<br/><br/>Such seekers also hope to have visions of Desna, such as those who have been blessed with tritidair-influenced dreams have claimed to receive. These assertions can be true-Desna can use the neural pathways a tritidair’s influence opens to communicate with other beings likely to aid the goddess’s aims. Good-hearted dreamers find themselves becoming more spontaneous and venturesome, looking for opportunities to explore and help others. With this increase in boldness comes an increase in apparent luck, although what seems to be luck is just as likely to be an increased awareness of good opportunities and the willingness to seize them.<br/><br/>Extra Content<br/><br/>The following extra content was found for this creature:<br/><br/>- Azata (Summoning) Graft Template<br/><br/>- Azata (Creature Subtype) Graft Template</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Elysium)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or flight (3-8)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","public":""},"type":"Outsider (azata, chaotic, extraplanar, good)","environment":"","cr":8,"xp":{"value":4800},"source":"AA2 (pg. 14)","subtype":"Azata, Chaotic, Extraplanar, Good","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":21,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":16,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":21,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":16,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"small","senses":"darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision","languages":{"value":["celestial","common"],"custom":"Truespeech"},"di":{"value":["electricity","fire"],"custom":"Petrification, Radiation"},"dr":{"value":[{"cold":"10"}],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":"Petrification, Radiation"},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":"0","max":"0"},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":"0","max":"0"},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Tritidair","displayName":40,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":60,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"QLcnkJ9LoNCWyOju","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false,"lightColor":"","mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false},"items":[{"flags":{},"name":"Light Ray (Su)","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"A tritidair’s light ray has a range increment of 90 feet.

Individually, these creatures have significant physical variety, resembling wasps, mantises, and moths, among others. Each inch‑long spathinae is much like the insect it resembles, but thousands organize themselves to form a biological and neural network. The result is a colony that operates much like a single sapient creature.<br><br>Such a colony is like a swarm and refers to themselves in the plural, but their consciousness is specific, with one personality and set of memories. The colony can alter their shape. Most take humanoid form, speaking with a buzzing, layered voice from a featureless “head.” Spathinae colonies prefer armor adjusted so each constituent can wear one component, allowing the colony to behave like a swarm.<br><br>Most colonies realize creatures made up of a single contiguous mass can have difficulty thinking of a distributed sapience as a group with a common purpose, rather than a single creature able to act like a swarm. Most spathinae use the colony’s name without pointing out that each constituent has its own name.<br><br>Damage can disrupt a spathinae colony’s network, or even cause the colony to “die,” their connection failing and sapience fading away. Hundreds of constituents might survive, but the colony dissipates, barring magic that returns life to and reunifies the disintegrated consciousness. Remnants of “dead” colonies might join other constituents to form a new colony, but any connection to the original is ephemeral.<br><br>Spathinae do not grieve such losses. Many revere Oras and see life as a constant process of exploration and change. Constituents make sacrifices so the colony can thrive. Colonies take risks, face challenges, adapt, and dissolve to advance their species. A given colony can endure for more than a century, but colonies also disperse and re-form, surrendering individuality for greater good.<br><br>Even the spathinae do not know where they originated—any records of this place were lost to the Gap. They have no clear indication if any planet on which they now reside was their home world. Most spathinae colonies pay little heed to their lack of history, however, as evolution continues without regard for the past. Some feel, though, that purposeful advancement requires them to seek their origin and learn from that place.<br><br>Most societies treat spathinae colonies as individuals, with the rights and obligations thereof. However, a few peoples, such as the Azlanti, see spathinae colonies as no more than a collection of bugs, and in such cases, the colonies have no rights at all.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2

Countless tendrils of semitangible shadow weave through the shodrav’s pallid body, leaving tubular openings like the burrowing of worms through flesh. These tendrils can cause similar wounds in a shodrav’s prey, sucking away life force before the shodrav devours the flesh.<br><br>While prey bleeds from wounds dealt by a shodrav’s tendrils, anyone looking through such a wound from either the Material Plane or the Shadow Plane sees the corresponding area on the opposite plane. These bizarre openings remain should a victim die from its injuries. Unscrupulous scholars and Kuthite zealots seek corpses that bear these windows to the Shadow Plane, harvesting the affected parts to create magic items.<br><br>Native to the Shadow Plane, shodravs distort the boundary between their home plane and other planes when they continuously inhabit areas where the Shadow Plane borders another. As the barrier thins, other creatures might inadvertently cross between the planes. In time, the veil can cease to exist altogether, with the Plane of Shadow’s features overwriting those of the corresponding area on the bordering plane. Older and stronger shodravs can affect greater areas, but only rarely an area wider than a large structure.<br><br>Shodravs prefer prey from the Material Plane, and often make lairs in Shadow Plane regions that border it, remaining until their native territories have displaced the Material Plane counterparts. Before the transformation is complete, a shodrav’s hidden presence can be inferred by mysterious disappearances or the unexplained presence of other creatures from the Shadow Plane. If a shodrav leaves its lair for an extended time, the region slowly returns to normal as the dimensional barriers re-form.<br><br>The average shodrav is 8 feet tall and 15 feet long, counting its tail.

As creatures with no motivations of their own, undead minions can also be found leaderless in the remains of ruined structures on planetary surfaces, adrift in derelict spacecraft, and even floating through the void of space. Whether encountered as servants of a mastermind who coordinates their movements or as a mindless threat in the wake of a cataclysmic disaster, undead minions are always a force to be reckoned with and a scourge to the living.<br><br>Though there are countless types of mindless undead who serve as minions, the most common are cybernetic zombies, occult zombies, and skeletal undead. Both occult zombies and skeletal undead are animated by magical or supernatural forces and created either in dark necromantic rituals (including the&nbsp;create undead&nbsp;spell) or by strange and mysterious reactions between the Material and Negative Energy Planes. Cybernetic zombies, on the other hand, arise as the result of technological implants that continue to function after their hosts have died, causing the body to act in a sad, shambling imitation of real life. Without control from an external force, these three kinds of undead simply go through the motions of their former lives, without reason, purpose, or the promise of an end to their miserable existences.<br><br>In the Pact Worlds, most undead hail from the dead world of Eox and were created by the bone sages, though zombies and skeletal creatures are also found among the wreckage of ancient battlefields on Akiton and the enigmatic, alien structures on Aucturn. In contrast, cybernetic zombies are most often found on worlds with high levels of technological development, such as Aballon, Castrovel, and Verces.<br><br>Those cultists of Urgathoa who see undeath as the pinnacle of being surround themselves with undead minions, both to use their abilities to terrorize innocent folk and to study their physiology in order to become undead themselves. While these worshipers would prefer to become more intelligent undead creatures, they often find that their fate is to rise up as a skeleton or zombie. Priests of Pharasma, on the other hand, often go out of their way to destroy all undead creatures, especially their mindless minions.<br><br>Undead minions can be formed from the corpses of any type of creature, though most of those appearing in folklore from across the galaxy are animated versions of whatever culture is telling the tale. Humanoids tell of ambulatory corpses rising from their ritual burial grounds, while aberrations, dragons, and magical beasts have their own legends of mindless dead of their own species returning to plague the living. Whatever the undead creatures’ original form, they often maintain natural attacks and other physical characteristics of their living counterparts even in undeath, though their mindless nature means they lose the ability to carry out complex tactics, conduct intricate or detailed tasks, and cast spells or take other mentally engaging actions. Yet the creatures’ mindlessness makes them all the more frightening and threatening, as they can be neither reasoned with nor cowed.<br><br>Use the following template grafts to create other versions of the undead minions presented here.</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, squad (3-8), or legion (9+)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Undead Minion","environment":"","cr":0.5,"xp":{"value":200},"source":"AA 1 (p 114)","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":9,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":4,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"medium","senses":"darkvision 60 ft.","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["cold"],"custom":"Undead Immunities"},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":"Undead Immunities"},"damageReduction":{"value":5,"negatedBy":"magic"},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{"sfrpg":{"conditions":[]}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Skeletal Undead","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"8sIsZVa5d5LJKeZ9","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false,"lightColor":"","mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false},"items":[{"_id":"855mSpMEATgu2dtx","flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false,"effects":[]}},"name":"Knife, survival","type":"weapon","img":"systems/sfrpg/icons/equipment/weapons/survival-knife.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>These light blades can be used for both mundane tasks and combat.

Rarely, other races under Xararian subjugation are also appointed as thaumaturges; after decades of study, they are finally allowed to don the traditional black flowing robes and elaborately carved staves that mark their high station.<br/><br/>Site Owner: Blake DavisEmail Spam Checker: MX Guarddog</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, entourage (1 plus 2-5 guardian creatures)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Offense</h2>\n<h3>Connection</h3>\n<p>star shaman</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","public":""},"type":"Humanoid","environment":"","cr":18,"xp":{"value":153600},"source":"AP #24 (p 61)","gender":"Male","subtype":"Xararian","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":31,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":36,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":31,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":36,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"medium","senses":"low-light vision","languages":{"value":[],"custom":"Truespeech"},"di":{"value":[],"custom":"Vacuum"},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":"Vacuum"},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":"0","max":"0"},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":"0","max":"0"},"spell5":{"value":"6","max":"6"},"spell6":{"value":"3","max":"3"}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Xararian","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"eYh3axKgaor7L7PY","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"IkGHrtzZkNkGhrCZ","flags":{},"name":"Staff, hardlight","type":"weapon","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Staves are long and flexible, weighted on the end to provide extra striking power.

Where the synapse worm stands out is in its unique feeding technique. The worm’s cranial cavity is lined with a membrane coated in an acidic and paralytic enzyme, which it can evert through its mouth in a thick effluvium that coats nearby surfaces with a branching, viscous web. This webbing can cause prey to enter a form of synaptic shock, thus giving the creature its name. The worm can then take nibbles of its prey without resistance—or in the case of smaller victims, such as spiders and insects, simply swallow them alive.<br><br>Synapse worms are opportunistic ambush predators with sharp-toothed maws and gullets strong enough to digest almost any organic substance. When hunting, a synapse worm burrows into the soil to wait for unsuspecting victims and then unleashes its paralytic webbing. If it wounds its prey enough to prevent the creature’s escape and the creature is too large to swallow whole, the worm then buries the victim alive to feast on later. Those unlucky enough to find a synapse worm’s hunting grounds regularly stumble across the rotting remains of those who previously fell to the vermin.<br><br>A synapse worm typically grows to about 3 to 4 feet long, and can raise itself up on its back half to stand a little over 2 feet tall. Its nearly nonexistent appendages are useless in combat, but they do allow it to move through soil. Synapse worms’ permeable skin naturally absorbs pigments from their surroundings, allowing a worm to blend quite well into its normal habitat. In a sterile environment, a synapse worm is a bright-blue color, with a cyan belly and webbing material that is white or, more rarely, reddish orange.<br><br>While no one is certain where synapse worms originated, these creatures can be found on a wide range of worlds throughout Near Space and the Vast. Luckily, no synapse worms have ever been seen in the wilds of the Pact Worlds, but a couple of eccentric collectors keep one or two of these vermin in their

Self-sufficient and able to construct their own weapons, they traditionally avoided large cities and the smaller races of the planet, except to engage in trade. As such, when Akiton suffered economic collapse, shobhads were largely spared the turmoil. In the aftermath, shobhads began to offer their services as guides, hunters, and mercenaries, often in trade for more advanced armor and weapons. Today, shobhads are highly sought after for their martial expertise, unparalleled knowledge of Akiton’s wilds, and unbreakable codes of honor. These warriors may operate independently, in their traditional clans, or in modern mercenary companies that blend ancestral traditions with the needs of modern military freelancers. While more shobhads can be spotted in Akiton’s new metropolises these days, the majority continue to live in the planet’s harsh hills and canyons.<br><br>Shobhads tend to wear their armor most of the time, usually with a traditional rope or leather weapon harness. Life among the shobhad-neh is hard, and young shobhads are trained from preadolescence to fight. By the age of 20, a shobhad is considered a full adult, capable of defending both her clan and her own honor against even the most experienced warriors. A typical shobhad warrior stands 12 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds, and most shobhads who do not die in battle live to between 90 and 120 years of age.<br><br>Most clans hunt, gather, and raid neighboring clans and corporate convoys for supplies. Shobhads believe that overt aggression isn’t a fault, but rather a fact of life and that everyone should be strong enough to protect themselves. However, honor is paramount to a shobhad, and breaking one’s word or clan law means a fate worse than death. The laws of city folk, on the other hand, mean little unless they’ve been agreed to.<br><br>Shobhads only rarely establish permanent settlements. A single clan may wander thousands of miles of open desert, their territory overlapping with that of other clans or species with very few disputes. While most clans remain on Akiton, their expertise in warfare means there’s always steady mercenary work for shobhad iconoclasts willing to travel, and a few clans have traded their caravans for starships. Such adventurers can often be found working for corporations or groups such as the Starfinder Society, usually as hired muscle. Some shobhads find themselves overtaken by nearly insatiable wanderlust, even after just a single off-planet job, and rarely set foot on Akiton again.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>cold deserts or mountains (Akiton)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, raiding party (3-19), or clan (20+ plus 1 warleader)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Monstrous Humanoid","environment":"","cr":4,"xp":{"value":1200},"source":"AA1 pg. 104","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":15,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":10,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":10,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":10,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"large","senses":"darkvision 60 ft.","languages":{"value":["shobhad"],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[{"cold":"5"}],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Shobhad","displayName":40,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"7rbaZsQ7kRHWzmWc","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"flags":{},"name":"Ferocity","type":"feat","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<h3>(EX)</h3>\n<h3>When the creature is brought to 0 Hit Points, it can fight on for 1 more round.

Weapons and combat-oriented creatures are commonly banned. In response, arms dealers and tech-minded assassins build combat drones disguised as toys. Many of these constructs are concealed only for transport, but some integrate their innocuous appearance into their functions with the intent of fooling potential victims as much as shipping securely. Not to be overlooked is the humiliation of being attacked by a toy.<br><br>One popular design is the devil-in-a-box. A figure, scary or cute, is stuffed into a box or similar container, from which it springs when activated. The construct has serrated limbs or jaws capable of slicing through modern composites and a keen virtual intelligence programmed to identify and track targets and to maim or kill. Common “devils” range from literal fiends to skittermanders with saw-like jaws or model Swarm thresher lords. These murderous toys are common enough that modern security gives more scrutiny to them in customs and boarding processes, but telling a mere toy from a killer drone is difficult.<br><br>High-end gaming devices have been used for similar ends. Gamedroids normally function, singly or in groups, to create sophisticated holographic game environments using rechargeable banks of spell chips embedded in their onboard casting units. Installing new spell chips into a prepackaged casting unit is difficult. However, weaponized casting units can be scratch-built in a reasonable amount of time and installed into gamedroids. A shipment of gamedroids can then become a delivery of assassins, loaded with combat magic. Like other weaponized toys, these lethal constructs need only to be assigned a target. And, since off-the-shelf models can be weaponized, tracing the perpetrators can be problematic.<br><br>Laws to control weaponized toys are hard to create and enforce. Lobbyists balk at legislation that burdens manufacturers or slows shipping. Apostae’s lobbyists in particular have been vocal that laws mustn’t hold producers accountable for misuse of their goods, as the precedent would be untenable and the reach overlarge. Responsibility lies, industry advocates insist, with law enforcement and the criminals who perpetrate such

Alternatively, you can have the hologram activate when a specific condition (which you set at the time of casting) occurs. The event that triggers the hologram can be as general or as specific and detailed as desired, but it must be based on an audible, olfactory, tactile, or visual trigger.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing where it is, and during your turn you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a move action. While you are using its senses, your body is considered blinded and deafened.If you desire, any spell you cast with a range of touch or greater can originate from the hologram instead of from you. The hologram can&rsquo;t cast spells on itself except for illusion spells. Spells cast in this manner affect other targets normally, despite originating from the hologram.

However, most scholars agree that the length of spiked chain that runs along a vespers hound’s back and seems to serve as its spine is definitely a velstrac addition. Those who witness a vespers hound extending that chain to envelop a nearby victim (and survive to tell the tale) are doubly certain about this theory.<br><br>Instinctively able to sniff out places where corruption and suffering have taken root, vespers hounds are sometimes used by velstracs as tracking beasts and faithful pets. Their presence seems to exacerbate dormant shadow corruption festering within mortals, and though vespers hounds don’t need to eat, they seem to enjoy tearing into such mortals’ flesh. A vespers hound is approximately 5 feet long, stands about 3 feet high at the shoulder, and weighs 140 pounds.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Shadow Plane)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary or clutch (2-5)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Outsider (extraplanar)","environment":"","cr":10,"xp":{"value":9600},"source":"AP #12 (p 61)","subtype":"Extraplanar","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":19,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":24,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":19,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":19,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":24,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"medium","senses":"blindsight (vibration) 60 ft.","languages":{"value":["common",{"infernal":"(can’t"}],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["cold"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{"sfrpg":{"conditions":[]}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Vesper Hound","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"vO0vT5EkZQsQxh7A","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"Ch1VxcvxIrx2LcAE","flags":{},"name":"Faceless (Ex)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"A vespers hound has no discernible facial features.

Resolve these attempts as normal, but use your caster level plus your key ability score modifier as your attack bonus. No saving throw is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally.

Self-sufficient and able to construct their own weapons, they traditionally avoided large cities and the smaller races of the planet, except to engage in trade. As such, when Akiton suffered economic collapse, shobhads were largely spared the turmoil. In the aftermath, shobhads began to offer their services as guides, hunters, and mercenaries, often in trade for more advanced armor and weapons. Today, shobhads are highly sought after for their martial expertise, unparalleled knowledge of Akiton’s wilds, and unbreakable codes of honor. These warriors may operate independently, in their traditional clans, or in modern mercenary companies that blend ancestral traditions with the needs of modern military freelancers. While more shobhads can be spotted in Akiton’s new metropolises these days, the majority continue to live in the planet’s harsh hills and canyons.<br><br>Shobhads tend to wear their armor most of the time, usually with a traditional rope or leather weapon harness. Life among the shobhad-neh is hard, and young shobhads are trained from preadolescence to fight. By the age of 20, a shobhad is considered a full adult, capable of defending both her clan and her own honor against even the most experienced warriors. A typical shobhad warrior stands 12 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds, and most shobhads who do not die in battle live to between 90 and 120 years of age.<br><br>Most clans hunt, gather, and raid neighboring clans and corporate convoys for supplies. Shobhads believe that overt aggression isn’t a fault, but rather a fact of life and that everyone should be strong enough to protect themselves. However, honor is paramount to a shobhad, and breaking one’s word or clan law means a fate worse than death. The laws of city folk, on the other hand, mean little unless they’ve been agreed to.<br><br>Shobhads only rarely establish permanent settlements. A single clan may wander thousands of miles of open desert, their territory overlapping with that of other clans or species with very few disputes. While most clans remain on Akiton, their expertise in warfare means there’s always steady mercenary work for shobhad iconoclasts willing to travel, and a few clans have traded their caravans for starships. Such adventurers can often be found working for corporations or groups such as the Starfinder Society, usually as hired muscle. Some shobhads find themselves overtaken by nearly insatiable wanderlust, even after just a single off-planet job, and rarely set foot on Akiton again.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>cold deserts or mountains (Akiton)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, clan (1 plus 20+ shobhads), or moot (2-8)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Monstrous Humanoid","environment":"","cr":7,"xp":{"value":3200},"source":"AA1 pg. 104","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":19,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":14,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":14,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":14,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"large","senses":"darkvision 60 ft.","languages":{"value":["shobhad"],"custom":"Akitonian"},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[{"cold":"5"}],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Shobhad Warleader","displayName":40,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"Rv27sQiDgfmp9qzw","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"flags":{},"name":"Ferocity","type":"feat","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<h3>(EX)</h3>\n<h3>When the creature is brought to 0 Hit Points, it can fight on for 1 more round.

Sazarons are large creatures with a lower body similar to an iguanodon, with two thick hind legs and two leaner front legs. Generally measuring 15 feet long and weighing 900 pounds, sazarons have long tails tipped with a large knob of bone that they can wield offensively. Starting at the saurian shoulders, the sazaron’s body transitions into the torso of a large humanoid. Their incredibly thick skin gives them electricity resistance, which is helpful in the weeks that their moon plunges into the electrically charged atmosphere of Liavara—and also insulates them from dirindis’ electric greetings.<br><br>Sazarons are scholarly creatures that move at a more measured pace than most other inhabitants of Arkanen, preferring to avoid conflict in order to study and further their knowledge. Instinctively skeptical, sazarons also have the ability to magically compel others to speak only the truth.<br><br>The ancient sazaron capital of Telataranas contains numerous magical universities and mystical academies, and a great number of sazaron sages, scholars, and scientists call the city home. These scholars are particularly interested in two fields of study. Those who study atmospheric submergence analyze phenomena related to Arkanen’s annual journey through of Liavara’s atmosphere, including its effects on their moon’s ecosystems and how best to store and ration the electricity collected by the gigantic pylons interspersed throughout the capital. These scholars often find themselves working alongside their electrically attuned dirindi fellows, while many of the less academically inclined are employed as part of the corps of electricians who maintain the pillars and energy reserves.<br><br>The other most popular topic of study focuses on the mind-searing hallajins, which Arkanen is tasked with containing on the nearby moon of Hallas via a magical barrier. Many of the sazarons who are passionate about this subject either have worked to become official Pact World overseers of the mysterious species, or work closely with those overseers to make sure that the dangerous psychic energy of Hallas does not escape. Despite their desire to learn more about the hallajins and their abilities, sazarons rigidly uphold the strict rules that prohibit attempts to sneak onto Hallas— though they are more than happy to confiscate and analyze any artifacts or data that any lawbreakers might obtain.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any

When that readied action is triggered, you cast <em>dispel magic</em> and must attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) to counter the other spellcaster’s spell.

They are often compared to many planets’ prehistoric megafauna, despite being much smaller. Veolisks are typically found only on remote planets and planetoids in the Vast, as most xenobiologists believe their maddening gazes tend to drive off other species and make settling near veolisk territory very difficult. If veolisks are discovered near established communities, the creatures are usually hunted ruthlessly until there are none left.<br><br>The veolisk’s signature void gaze ability has led to speculation that the creatures are descended from ancestors with similar gaze attacks that had far more severe effects, and they have earned the nickname “void basilisks” from those versed in the ancient folklore of Golarion. Some sages believe destruction-loving cultists of the Devourer bred the first veolisks millennia ago, well before the Gap. Whether or not this is true, the beasts have become popular as guardians of remote Devourer cult bases and as pets to those who believe themselves to be at one with the universe’s entropy. Curiously, though most cultures would never think to try domesticating veolisks, the beasts become quite docile and mostly harmless when wearing blinders, veils, or other methods of negating their gaze ability.<br><br>These hulking beasts can survive on very little food, usually eating only one small meal-flesh, fruits, fungus, plant life, or anything it can find-a day. Scientists don’t agree on exactly what maintains a veolisk’s physiology; some believe the creatures simply have a hyperefficient metabolism, while others suggest that they feed on cosmic radiation like trees gathering sustenance through photosynthesis. A few experts theorize that veolisks don’t need to eat at all to survive and subsist solely on the background arcane energies that are present everywhere in the galaxy. Reputable xenobiologists tend to scoff at this hypothesis, but their opponents are quick to point out that universe is full of strange and unknowable wonders that defy scientific explanation.<br><br>Veolisks lay fist-sized leathery eggs, usually six to eight at a time. These eggs are recognizable as belonging to a veolisk due to their ebony coloring and their tendency to give off faint wisps of odorless smoke. Once laid, the eggs don’t require any kind of incubation and usually hatch on their own after a few weeks. In most broods, the first veolisks to hatch tend to devour the unhatched eggs as their first meals. Veolisk young begin to hunt for themselves after this initial meal and are fully mature in less than a year. Adult veolisks usually mate whenever the opportunity presents itself, though neither parent takes any interest in their eggs or offspring.<br><br>A typical veolisk is about 7 feet long from the tip of

Concerned primarily with the protection and promulgation of the nascent plane, and of advanced technology in general, spectra are beings of paradox and dichotomy. Some metaphysicians believe that, just as the Drift grows by pulling in pieces of the multiverse each time a starship uses it to travel, so too are spectra created—amalgamations of raw, sometimes opposing energies born from the stolen pieces of other planes. Yet spectra are also undeniably of the Drift itself. They have inherent resistance to magic and can slip in and out of the Drift via innate esoteric—though purely technological—means. Some theorists posit that, like the beacons that enable travel through the Drift, spectra somehow exist simultaneously in multiple planes, manifesting in only one at any given time. Spectra rarely speak using their own voices, which are a mix of low-fidelity synthesized tones. They prefer to use their machine telepathy to temporarily harness nearby communication technology, speaking using a starship’s intercom or causing text to appear on a vidscreen, for instance.<br><br>Iridias are one of the few spectra encountered outside the Drift, most often on the Material Plane. Averaging 6 feet tall with opalescent skin and a coil of glistening rainbow light for hair, iridias serve as messengers and ambassadors to species of all planes, evangelizing the benefits of advanced technology and enforcing the tripartite will of Triune. Iridias have been known to visit remote worlds in the Vast where Triune’s original signal containing the secrets of Drift travel were lost or suppressed, bringing with them instructions and a second chance to join the galactic community. They are also keen to see mortal technology continue to grow and advance—an interest that can put them at odds with societies that choose to limit technology’s influence, as well as others wary of sudden unfettered progress, such as the tekhoinos aeons.<br><br>Aspecnas, powerful spectra paragons with fan-like tails and faces that resemble blooming flowers, rarely interact directly with the Material Plane. These formidable outsiders instead concern themselves with maintaining the precarious balance of power among extraplanar forces in the Drift, opposing any who would attempt to establish strongholds with the intent of laying their own claim to a substantial expanse of Triune’s realm. Aspecnas have on occasion appeared to correct the course of mortals who have become lost in the ever-shifting plane, and even intervened to protect weaker mortals from the predation of malevolent Drift-marooned outsiders. These rare but memorable acts have earned aspecnas the nickname “Drift angels” among those who regularly travel through the plane.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (the Drift)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary or sequence (2, 3, 5, or 8)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Outsider","environment":"","cr":8,"xp":{"value":4800},"source":"AA3 pg. 102","subtype":"Extraplanar, Spectra","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":16,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":21,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":16,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":21,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":21,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":16,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":16,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"medium","senses":"darkvision 60 ft.","languages":{"value":[],"custom":"Machine Telepathy 100 ft., truespeech"},"di":{"value":["electricity"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[{"cold":"5"},{"sonic":"5"}],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"damageReduction":{"value":5,"negatedBy":"chaotic, evil, good, or lawful"},"sr":19},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":"0","max":"0"},"spell2":{"value":"3","max":"3"},"spell3":{"value":"1","max":"1"},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Iridia","displayName":40,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"Hoc92BDjAB5Ll4CM","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false,"lightColor":"","mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false},"items":[{"flags":{},"name":"Void Adaptation","type":"feat","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<h3>(EX OR SU)</h3>\n<h3>Numerous creatures are inured to the void of outer space.

The hologram can include intelligible speech, if you wish.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5th:</strong> When you cast holographic image as a 5th-level spell, it produces a hologram as per the 4th-level version of the spell, except the size of the hologram can&rsquo;t extend beyond a 20-foot cube plus one 10-foot cube per caster level. You can choose to make the hologram permanent at the time of casting. By concentrating, you can move the image within the limits of the range, but it is static while you are not concentrating. Alternatively, you can have the hologram activate when a specific condition (which you set at the time of casting) occurs. The event that triggers the hologram can be as general or as specific and detailed as desired, but it must be based on an audible, olfactory, tactile, or visual trigger.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing where it is, and during your turn you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a move action.

Interplanar and interplanetary travel is not possible, and neither is travel between two moving starships during combat, though you might be able to teleport to a planet’s surface from an orbiting starship. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed your maximum bulk limit. You can also bring up to five additional willing or unconscious Medium or smaller creatures (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or their equivalent. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, and a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As the caster, you need not attempt a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use by another creature receive saving throws and benefit from spell resistance.<br><br>You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy can make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult Table 10–1. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.<br><br><strong>Familiarity:</strong> “Very familiar” describes a place you have been very often and where you feel at home. “Studied carefully” describes a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or because you’ve been there often. “Seen casually” describes a place you have been to more than once but with which you are not very familiar. “Viewed once” describes a place you have seen once in person or have extensively studied through scrying magic, remote cameras, or recorded images (for a remote-viewed location, you still need to have a clear idea of the location; you can’t teleport to an unknown location that you’ve seen in a holovid).<br><br>“False destination” describes a place that doesn’t truly exist, or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location, it is a place that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.<br><br><strong>On Target:</strong> You appear where you want to be.<br><br><strong>Off Target:</strong> You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. The distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.<br><br><strong>Similar Area:</strong> You wind up in an area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell’s range, the spell simply fails instead.<br><br><strong>Mishap:</strong> You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten “scrambled.” You each take 2d10 damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time “mishap” comes up, the creatures take more damage and must reroll.<br><br></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Familiarity</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\"><strong>On Target</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Off Target</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Similar Area</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Mishap</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\">Very familiar</td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\">1–97</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\">98–99</td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\">100</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\">—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\">Studied carefully</td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\">1–94</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\">95–97</td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\">98–99</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\">100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\">Seen casually</td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\">1–88</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\">89–94</td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\">95–98</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\">99–100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\">Viewed once</td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\">1–76</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\">77–88</td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\">89–96</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\">97–100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 114.683px; text-align: center;\">False destination</td>\n<td style=\"width: 66.9833px; text-align: center;\">—</td>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8333px; text-align: center;\">—</td>\n<td style=\"width: 85.1333px; text-align: center;\">81–92</td>\n<td style=\"width: 53.3667px; text-align: center;\">93–100</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 381","type":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"type":""},"area":{"value":null,"units":"","shape":"","effect":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"ft","additional":"","per":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"parts":[],"effect":""},"damage":{"parts":[]},"formula":"","save":{"type":"","dc":null,"descriptor":""},"descriptors":[],"modifiers":[],"level":3,"school":"con","sr":false,"dismissible":false,"concentration":false,"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"","prepared":false},"allowedClasses":{"myst":false,"tech":true,"wysh":true},"abilityMods":{"parts":[]}},"labels":{"level":"3rd Level","school":"Conjuration","activation":"","target":"","area":"","range":"Feet","duration":"","save":"","damage":""},"isStack":false,"hasUses":false,"hasAttack":false,"isCharged":true},{"flags":{},"name":"Caustic Conversion","type":"spell","img":"systems/sfrpg/icons/spells/caustic_conversion.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">You fling magical nanites that convert water vapor around your target into deadly acid.

Valkyries appear on battlefields throughout the galaxy in search of combatants of great skill and renown, supernaturally aware of who is ready to accept death’s embrace and who yearns to fight on another day. When she locates such a target, a valkyrie can either claim the soul of a deceased warrior or aid the living to continue the battle. Though space travel is a relatively recent development for some mortal species, the valkyries took to the stars long ago to advance their quest of collecting the souls of worthy fighters. As a result, diverse cultures across the universe, most notably those of the Pact Worlds and the Veskarium, recognize these powerful extraplanar creatures as choosers of the slain.<br/><br/>Valkyries are always female and frequently appear as powerful and majestic human or vesk women. A human valkyrie is 6 feet tall and weighs close to 200 pounds, while a vesk valkyrie is 8 feet tall and weighs approximately 300 pounds. Valkyries may take on the appearance of other species if they wish, and references to “warrior angels” wreathed in lightning exist within many cultures outside the Pact Worlds.<br/><br/>Valkyries are most often associated with gods of war, conflict, valor, and courage. Some valkyries are independent, serving no deity directly-a fact that suggests the outsiders are mercenaries by nature and have complex, ever-changing allegiances to the divine. Whatever a given valkyrie’s associations, her duty is sacred: to protect the souls of slain heroes on their journey from the Material Plane to the Boneyard, where they face judgment and learn their final destination in the Outer Planes. What qualifies a soul for this honor varies by deity-and various cultures and faiths across the galaxy interpret the worth of a warrior in vastly different ways. Valkyries hold a special place in the dominant religion of the Veskarium, where they are referred to as the Spear Maidens of Damoritosh.<br/><br/>Valkyries also come to the aid of warriors who are near death-or even recently dead-but still have a fierce drive to fight on. In this way, a valkyrie’s intervention has turned the tide of battle in countless conflicts across the galaxy.<br/><br/>The mysteries surrounding the afterlife extend to valkyries and their practices, and mortals have questioned for millennia why the striking outsiders shepherd the souls of dead heroes. Some skeptics even posit that valkyries divert souls from their rightful course, collecting them for some great and terrible conflict to come, or stocking grand arenas for the entertainment of beings of unknowable power and alien intellect. This theory holds little credence among scholars, however, who note no recorded conflicts between valkyries and servants of Pharasma, the goddess of life and death, who would certainly object to such subversion.<br/><br/>In the years since the Gap, many valkyries have forgone their traditional sleipnir or pegasus mounts and adopted modern suits of armor. Armor and weapons created by valkyrie engineers blend the latest nanocarbon and polymer technology with powerful magic, resulting in creations that armorers of the Material Plane can only dream about. Occasionally, a valkyrie might gift such a suit of armor, or perhaps a unique weapon, to a mortal warrior she deems worthy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary or ride (2-8 valkyries)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","public":""},"type":"Outsider (extraplanar)","environment":"","cr":12,"xp":{"value":19200},"source":"AA 3 (p 124)","subtype":"Extraplanar","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":22,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":22,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":22,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":27,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":22,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"medium","senses":"darkvision 60 ft.; death sense 30 ft.","languages":{"value":["celestial","common"],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["cold","electricity"],"custom":"Poison"},"dr":{"value":[{"acid":"10"},{"fire":"10"}],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":"Poison"},"damageReduction":{"value":10,"negatedBy":"cold iron and lawful"},"sr":23},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{"sfrpg":{"conditions":[]}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Valkyrie","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"alPYrpchK9mwTLYv","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false,"lightColor":"","mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false},"items":[{"_id":"HGtFUifHdq2UkXK1","flags":{},"name":"Shot on the Run (Combat)","type":"feat","img":"systems/sfrpg/icons/feats/shot_on_the_run.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>You can move, fire a ranged weapon, and move again before your foes can react.<br><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Dex 15, Mobility, base attack bonus +4.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>Benefit</strong>: As a full action, you can move up to your speed and make a single ranged attack at any point during your movement.

Eventually, the decomposing body reanimates and the newly risen jiang-shi goes in search of living creatures to feed upon.<br><br>A jiang-shi’s appearance depends on both the circumstances of the creature’s death and the state of its corpse at the time of its reanimation. A jiang-shi that fell to its death on a warm, wet world would likely have twisted or broken limbs and be in a state of advanced putrefaction, while one who was killed by laser fire on an airless asteroid in the void of space might exhibit laser burns but manifest no signs of decomposition at all. Regardless of the state of decay, most jiang-shis wear clothing or gear that is out of style, if not completely outdated, due to the fact that it can take decades-or even centuries-before a jiang-shi rises from the dead.<br><br>All jiang-shis display a prayer scroll in front of their faces. In ancient, pre-Gap days, these prayer scrolls were handwritten on parchment and affixed to the corpse’s brow with stitches or staples in order to protect the deceased from the ravages of restless spirits. In modern times, holographic prayer scrolls projected in front of a jiang-shi’s forehead have typically replaced the parchment scrolls and protect the jiang-shi’s body from both physical and magical harm. If a jiang-shi’s prayer scroll is ever stolen or destroyed, it loses the defensive benefits granted by the scroll (see above), but the jiang-shi may replace it with a handwritten scroll. This requires a strip of paper or cloth, a writing implement, and 10 minutes of uninterrupted work. Alternatively, a jiang-shi can recreate a holographic prayer scroll by crafting a hybrid holoskin (Starfinder Core Rulebook 220) to project the scroll. This requires at least 2 ranks in both the Engineering and Mysticism skills and UPBs worth 500 credits.<br><br>Because most jiang-shis become undead only after their corpses have undergone some measure of decomposition, their bodies often display signs of rigor mortis. The rigid inflexibility of a jiang-shi’s muscle tissue makes the creature’s movements especially stiff, and causes the distinctive bouncing gait which gives jiang-shis their colloquial name of hopping vampires. Nevertheless, jiang-shis can be surprisingly nimble in rough terrain, and the stiffness of their joints has little adverse effect in zero gravity.<br><br>Jiang-shis are horrified by their own reflections, and the sound of a handbell or the call of a rooster fills them with terror. Cooked rice, which reminds jiang-shis that they are dead and can no longer eat normal food, shames them. Curiously, uncooked rice and other types of grain (cooked or not) don’t affect jiang-shis at all, though rice mixed with vinegar and the dust of a destroyed jiang-shi prevents that vampire from returning to unlife.<br><br>Although they normally try to avoid daylight, jiang-shis suffer no detrimental effects from sunlight and can move around during the day unharmed. Nevertheless, most jiang-shis prefer to operate at night or in darkness, when their more obvious physical traits are not as noticeable to the living among whom they mingle. On the other hand, a glowing holographic prayer scroll can be difficult to conceal in the darkness.<br><br>Jiang-shis tend to lead solitary existences, but they are not averse to working with other undead creatures, especially if those undead feed on the flesh of the living, leaving the victim’s chi for the jiang-shi to drain. However, jiang-shis are known to be jealous of blood-sucking vampires because of their ability to create their own undead spawn. As a result, most hopping vampires refuse to cooperate with their bloodsucking rivals, even if they might profit from such an arrangement.<br><br>In the Pact Worlds, jiang-shis are most associated with the dead world of Eox, though the hopping vampires can be found anywhere there are living, breathing creatures to feed upon. Some jiang-shis serve as officers in the exiled Corpse Fleet as well, working just as tirelessly as their other undead comrades-in-arms for Eoxian supremacy and independence. At least one of the Golden League’s powerful families is said to be led by an ancient jiang-shi matriarch who was alive on pre-Gap Golarion, and inhabitants of Absalom Station’s “Downside” swear that a cabal of seven jiang-shis has inhabited an abandoned level of the Spike since at least the end of the Gap. Each member of the cabal supposedly “specializes” in drinking the breath of just one species, and refuses to feed on the chi of a different race.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary or cabal (2-8)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Undead","environment":"","cr":6,"xp":{"value":2400},"source":"AP #3 (p 58)","raceAndGrafts":"Elebrian jiang-shi operative","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":19,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":19,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":19,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":14,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":19,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":14,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"medium","senses":"blindsight (breath) 60 ft., darkvision 60 ft.","languages":{"value":["common","eoxian"],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":"Effects From Spell Gems; Undead Immunities"},"dr":{"value":[{"cold":"10"}],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":"Jiang-Shi Weaknesses"},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":"Effects From Spell Gems; Undead Immunities"},"damageReduction":{"value":10,"negatedBy":"magic"},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{"sfrpg":{"conditions":[]}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Jiang-Shi","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"WLKh3tH2HugbIbKV","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"Y8DvcLEAtOZmcwgv","flags":{},"name":"Evasion (Ex) (Operative)","type":"feat","img":"systems/sfrpg/icons/classes/evasion.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>&gt;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.classes\" data-id=\"uf8ADOAeBrtUkPVl\" draggable=\"true\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Operative</a></p>\n        <p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\">If you succeed at a Reflex save against an effect that normally has a partial effect on a successful save, you instead suffer no effect.

They are drawn to open interplanar portals and to areas where the barriers between dimensions are weak. Life, especially when coupled with warmth, attracts these creatures like the stench of death attracts carrion birds. The oozes feed on the subtle negative energy surrounding the dying and recently dead, using that energy to reproduce.<br/><br/>These creatures can hibernate indefinitely, and they are inured to outer space and airless environments. Because of these traits, void oozes can be found almost anywhere. Explorers have encountered them on planets (habitable or not), asteroids, and spacedocks. The oozes have also been found aboard vessels that have traveled in the darkest regions of space, where the oozes attached themselves to the hull of a passing starship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Shadow Plane)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or gloom (3-6)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","public":""},"type":"Ooze","environment":"","cr":7,"xp":{"value":3200},"source":"AP #10 (p 61)","aura":"Shadow Siphon - 20 Ft.","raceAndGrafts":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":14,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":19,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"medium","senses":"blindsight (vibration) 60 ft., sightless","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":"Ooze Immunities"},"dr":{"value":[{"cold":"5"}],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":"Ooze Immunities"},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{"sfrpg":{"conditions":[]}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Void Ooze","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"obcREFooiAFMAWiW","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"HoIJBKGGBnPTaaib","flags":{},"name":"Shadow Siphon (Su)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"Nonmagical bright or normal light within 20 feet of a void ooze is reduced to dim light.

If the owner fails to use proper shutdown procedures prior to disposal, automated self-preservation subroutines sometimes kick in before the machine’s destruction, prompting it to escape its fate. With no home to return to, these cast-off robots subsist in the dark corners of cities, space stations, and massive starships across the galaxy. Collectively known as scrap-bots, they come in endless shapes and styles, but they share a drive to continue existing and mistrust of the civilization that discarded them.<br><br>Scrap-bots that find one another band together for security, living in packs that search for useful tech to replace their malfunctioning components. Dirty, rusting, and cobbled together from mismatched parts, most scrap-bots are seen as little more than pests that other members of society ignore. This social condition makes scrap-bots ideal informants and lookouts for criminals, who buy their loyalty with parts and fresh batteries. Willing to perform almost any task for such pay, scrap-bots have an uncanny devotion to each other. In their optical sensors, the galaxy has two kinds of beings. That divide is between scrap-bots and “users”—those who make, use, and dispose of technology without care. Scrapbots are prone to distrust all users, although other outcasts have an easier time earning scrap-bot trust and respect.<br><br>In combat, individual scrap-bots pose little threat and prefer to flee or acquiesce to an aggressor rather than face destruction. However, as their numbers grow, so does their boldness. Presented with an opportunity posing minimal risk, a scrap-bot gang might resort to assault, burglary, and robbery to acquire what the group needs.<br><br>The scrap-bots presented here are only an array of several possibilities. Different configurations and combinations of those designs exist. Mightier scrap-bots might also be found in industrial areas in decline, such as the abandoned refineries of Akiton.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any

Concerned primarily with the protection and promulgation of the nascent plane, and of advanced technology in general, spectra are beings of paradox and dichotomy. Some metaphysicians believe that, just as the Drift grows by pulling in pieces of the multiverse each time a starship uses it to travel, so too are spectra created—amalgamations of raw, sometimes opposing energies born from the stolen pieces of other planes. Yet spectra are also undeniably of the Drift itself. They have inherent resistance to magic and can slip in and out of the Drift via innate esoteric—though purely technological—means. Some theorists posit that, like the beacons that enable travel through the Drift, spectra somehow exist simultaneously in multiple planes, manifesting in only one at any given time. Spectra rarely speak using their own voices, which are a mix of low-fidelity synthesized tones. They prefer to use their machine telepathy to temporarily harness nearby communication technology, speaking using a starship’s intercom or causing text to appear on a vidscreen, for instance.<br><br>Iridias are one of the few spectra encountered outside the Drift, most often on the Material Plane. Averaging 6 feet tall with opalescent skin and a coil of glistening rainbow light for hair, iridias serve as messengers and ambassadors to species of all planes, evangelizing the benefits of advanced technology and enforcing the tripartite will of Triune. Iridias have been known to visit remote worlds in the Vast where Triune’s original signal containing the secrets of Drift travel were lost or suppressed, bringing with them instructions and a second chance to join the galactic community. They are also keen to see mortal technology continue to grow and advance—an interest that can put them at odds with societies that choose to limit technology’s influence, as well as others wary of sudden unfettered progress, such as the tekhoinos aeons.<br><br>Aspecnas, powerful spectra paragons with fan-like tails and faces that resemble blooming flowers, rarely interact directly with the Material Plane. These formidable outsiders instead concern themselves with maintaining the precarious balance of power among extraplanar forces in the Drift, opposing any who would attempt to establish strongholds with the intent of laying their own claim to a substantial expanse of Triune’s realm. Aspecnas have on occasion appeared to correct the course of mortals who have become lost in the ever-shifting plane, and even intervened to protect weaker mortals from the predation of malevolent Drift-marooned outsiders. These rare but memorable acts have earned aspecnas the nickname “Drift angels” among those who regularly travel through the plane.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (the Drift)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary or triad (1 aspecna and 2 iridias)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Outsider","environment":"","cr":18,"xp":{"value":153600},"source":"AA3 pg. 102","subtype":"Extraplanar, Spectra","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":31,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":36,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":36,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":36,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":31,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":31,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"huge","senses":"darkvision 60 ft., detect alignment","languages":{"value":[],"custom":"Machine Telepathy 100 ft., truespeech"},"di":{"value":["electricity"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[{"cold":"5"},{"sonic":"5"}],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"damageReduction":{"value":15,"negatedBy":"chaotic, evil, good, or lawful"},"sr":29},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":"0","max":"0"},"spell5":{"value":"3","max":"3"},"spell6":{"value":"3","max":"3"}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Aspecna","displayName":40,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"NLHIcz9RtPnJczcV","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false,"lightColor":"","mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false},"items":[{"flags":{},"name":"Void Adaptation","type":"feat","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<h3>(EX OR SU)</h3>\n<h3>Numerous creatures are inured to the void of outer space.

Alternatively, you can have the hologram activate when a specific condition (which you set at the time of casting) occurs. The event that triggers the hologram can be as general or as specific and detailed as desired, but it must be based on an audible, olfactory, tactile, or visual trigger.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing where it is, and during your turn you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a move action. While you are using its senses, your body is considered blinded and deafened.If you desire, any spell you cast with a range of touch or greater can originate from the hologram instead of from you.

Standing between 10 and 15 feet tall with bulbous eyes and spindly, elongated limbs, a sarcesian is able to adapt her physiology to survive in space by suspending her respiration and growing a pair of butterfly-like wings made of pure light. The wings act as solar sails, catching currents of radiation to propel her between the handful of inhabited asteroids and space platforms within the Diaspora.<br><br>Thanks to arcane engines left behind by the sarcesians’ ancestors, the race has long managed to maintain creche worlds—asteroids with enough magical atmosphere, gravity, and warmth for the inhabitants to live comfortably and raise offspring. Compared to some other planets in the Golarion system, sarcesian creche worlds are beautiful and idyllic. They contain fields, forests, hills, lakes, and bucolic towns whose populations number in the low thousands. Many of these sanctuaries are linked by the River Between, an unusual body of water that actually flows between and through the asteroids; the water is prevented from floating off into space by a tube-shaped force field crafted by unknown hands.<br><br>Sarcesians who leave the asteroid belt are sometimes hired as mercenaries specializing in surveillance and marksmanship, as they are accustomed to operating at vast distances from their targets.

Both occult zombies and skeletal undead are animated by magical or supernatural forces and created either in dark necromantic rituals (including the&nbsp;create undead&nbsp;spell) or by strange and mysterious reactions between the Material and Negative Energy Planes. Cybernetic zombies, on the other hand, arise as the result of technological implants that continue to function after their hosts have died, causing the body to act in a sad, shambling imitation of real life. Without control from an external force, these three kinds of undead simply go through the motions of their former lives, without reason, purpose, or the promise of an end to their miserable existences.<br><br>In the Pact Worlds, most undead hail from the dead world of Eox and were created by the bone sages, though zombies and skeletal creatures are also found among the wreckage of ancient battlefields on Akiton and the enigmatic, alien structures on Aucturn. In contrast, cybernetic zombies are most often found on worlds with high levels of technological development, such as Aballon, Castrovel, and Verces.<br><br>Those cultists of Urgathoa who see undeath as the pinnacle of being surround themselves with undead minions, both to use their abilities to terrorize innocent folk and to study their physiology in order to become undead themselves. While these worshipers would prefer to become more intelligent undead creatures, they often find that their fate is to rise up as a skeleton or zombie. Priests of Pharasma, on the other hand, often go out of their way to destroy all undead creatures, especially their mindless minions.<br><br>Undead minions can be formed from the corpses of any type of creature, though most of those appearing in folklore from across the galaxy are animated versions of whatever culture is telling the tale. Humanoids tell of ambulatory corpses rising from their ritual burial grounds, while aberrations, dragons, and magical beasts have their own legends of mindless dead of their own species returning to plague the living. Whatever the undead creatures’ original form, they often maintain natural attacks and other physical characteristics of their living counterparts even in undeath, though their mindless nature means they lose the ability to carry out complex tactics, conduct intricate or detailed tasks, and cast spells or take other mentally engaging actions. Yet the creatures’ mindlessness makes them all the more frightening and threatening, as they can be neither reasoned with nor cowed.<br><br>Use the following template grafts to create other versions

Standing between 10 and 15 feet tall with bulbous eyes and spindly, elongated limbs, a sarcesian is able to adapt her physiology to survive in space by suspending her respiration and growing a pair of butterfly-like wings made of pure light. The wings act as solar sails, catching currents of radiation to propel her between the handful of inhabited asteroids and space platforms within the Diaspora.<br><br>Thanks to arcane engines left behind by the sarcesians’ ancestors, the race has long managed to maintain creche worlds—asteroids with enough magical atmosphere, gravity, and warmth for the inhabitants to live comfortably and raise offspring. Compared to some other planets in the Golarion system, sarcesian creche worlds are beautiful and idyllic. They contain fields, forests, hills, lakes, and bucolic towns whose populations number in the low thousands. Many of these sanctuaries are linked by the River Between, an unusual body of water that actually flows between and through the asteroids; the water is prevented from floating off into space by a tube-shaped force field crafted by unknown hands.<br><br>Sarcesians who leave the asteroid belt are sometimes hired as mercenaries specializing in surveillance and marksmanship, as they are accustomed to operating at vast distances from their targets. These sarcesians hone their innate patience even further in order to lie in wait for their marks for days atop bluffs, in dilapidated apartments, or even in the vacuum of space outside docking slips. Employers tend to pay well for this degree of dedication, making sarcesian snipers a highly sought-after commodity in certain areas of the galaxy.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any low-gravity (Diaspora)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or regiment (3-5)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Humanoid","environment":"","cr":8,"xp":{"value":4800},"source":"AA1 pg. 98","subtype":"Sarcesian","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":21,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":21,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":21,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":16,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":16,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":16,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"large","senses":"low-light vision","languages":{"value":["common","sarcesian"],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Sarcesian Cybercommando","displayName":40,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"qh52ISrcIrbhf7gm","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.rp"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"flags":{},"name":"Dueling sword, buzzblade","type":"weapon","img":"systems/sfrpg/icons/equipment/weapons/dueling-sword.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>While dueling swords are crafted to be aesthetically pleasing and are often seen as a mark of rank or tradition, many warriors still train with them to deadly effect.

A valnarum’s fur is mottled blue and purple with a series of black spots that provides simple camouflage in forest and jungle terrain. In addition to its long tail, a valnarum has a pair of blue, glowing wings made of pure energy that allow the creature to fly through space and provide protection from cosmic radiation.<br/><br/>Originally from Lexonia VII-the seventh satellite of the star Lexon and a magic-filled world of massive, interconnected forests-valnarums became the apex predators on the planet after mystically evolving their energy wings. As valnarums continually moved upward through the ecosystem’s massive canopies, which abutted the edge of the planet’s atmosphere, they gradually adapted to micro-gravity and the lack of breathable air. Eventually, mutations allowed valnarums to travel through space and visit other worlds.<br/><br/>Though they travel throughout the galaxy in small groups known as chains to hunt new and exciting prey, valnarums aren’t ruthless destroyers. When they discover a planet they haven’t visited before, they attempt to make contact with the world’s dominant species to ask permission to hunt. Most valnarums try to respect the laws and customs wherever they land and kill only what they need to survive, though they enjoy the thrill of tracking down a creature they’ve never feasted upon

Solar wisps are blobs of ejecta from a sun’s corona that have taken on a modicum of sentience. No one is exactly sure how solar wisps originate, though some believe it is Sarenrae’s divine will, while others point toward a consciousness similar to that of elementals, claiming that solar wisps are nothing more than cousins of fire elementals. But while it is true solar wisps are amorphous orbs of burning plasma with almost animal-level intelligence, the similarities end there. These creatures have a long and unique life cycle that begins in a star and can end in calamity.<br><br>When a solar wisp is “born,” it measures about 20 feet in diameter, but the material of its being is loosely held together by minor gravitational forces. At this point, a solar wisp isn’t much more than a red-hot cloud of colloidal matter. Driven by instinct, the solar wisp attaches itself to a nearby fast-moving celestial body (usually a comet), which eventually takes it close to a planet or moon containing the minerals on which the solar wisp feeds. As it burns its way across such a landscape, the solar wisp gains more mass but shrinks in size. Responding to unknown stimuli, the solar wisp launches itself back into space to latch onto another comet or meteor to repeat the process.<br><br>As a solar wisp feeds and ages, it increases in density but decreases in diameter. Despite its reduction in size to a mere few feet in diameter, a mature solar wisp burns with far greater intensity and is much more dangerous than a juvenile. A solar wisp of any age and size can pose a threat, however, as it is unwavering in its pursuit of food, consuming the minerals it seeks out in its internal furnace. This can be a destructive process that puts it in conflict with other species—especially if those species also rely on the same minerals for economic stability. Most creatures that attempt to stop a mature solar wisp underestimate its abilities thanks to its small size. Its effects on local gravity and its intense heat mean that most who confront a solar wisp are lucky if they get away with only severe burns.<br><br>Though it has a life span measured in centuries—and sometimes multiple thousands of years—a solar wisp does eventually die. An elderly solar wisp is a tiny ball that burns like a nuclear explosion, and when it expires, it implodes into a gravitational singularity that affects a half-mile radius. Though this miniature black hole lasts for less than an hour, it poses a great danger to those caught in its pull. A recent report from Near Space tells of an entire nascent colony wiped out by a dying solar wisp that, until then, had served as a kind of mascot and beacon for the unfortunate settlers.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Photino Crystals</h2>\n<p>In their travels, solar wisps sometimes shed portions of themselves, which cool rapidly into a glittering stream of beautiful bright-orange jewels called photino crystals that are used throughout the Pact Worlds (and beyond) as naturally occurring solarian weapon crystals. A few small starship crews make a dangerous living by following wisps— at a great distance—and waiting for this molting, scooping up the resulting jewels until their cargo holds are full, and then returning to a safer location to sort them by quality.

These metropolises stand as a testament to the perseverance and resourcefulness of the planet’s most notable inhabitants: crystalline humanoids known as shimreens. Shimreens built their domes not only to protect their cities from the storms, but also to harness the abundant available energy that powers their civilization. According to surviving records, the crystalline people have been doing this since long before the Gap.<br><br>Shimreens are composed of glimmering crystal, and the average shimreen is 7 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds. Though their tall, angular bodies can be any color (or even clear), most tend toward cool, bright jewel tones such as blue, purple, or teal. Much like their radiant metropolises, shimreens glow from within.<br><br>The most popular legend about how shimreens came to be holds that the first shimreen was kissed by lightning, rising out of the earth and into sapience—and that their spark has passed down through the generations. Whatever their origins, modern shimreen are not so much born as they are made. Pharasma’s Forge, once merely a small volcanic hotspot, has developed over millennia into a sacred temple of making and unmaking. Narrow canals, carved into the mountain’s face in ray-like patterns, direct small rivers of lava into creation chambers. To form a new shimreen, fragments from one or more living parents are placed into a chamber, which is superheated by lava until either a soul is attracted to the seed crystals and a new shimreen is formed, or the contributed shards are consumed. It’s possible for a single shimreen to reproduce alone, or for each member of a large family unit to donate a piece of themselves. Since shimreens generally live for centuries, when one passes away, their body is taken in a solemn procession to be added to the lava that powers Pharasma’s Forge so that they may contribute to the making of new life. Shimreens are able to change their body slightly to fit their needs, including shifting an arm into a crystal lance or adjusting their constant internal glow. A significant number of shimreens shape the crystals atop their heads to form crowns, while others let the crystals around their faces grow wild to form clusters they call manes— and some do both.<br><br>Thanks to Shimrinsara’s endless source of energy, its citizens are employed chiefly in the pursuit of culture and trade, rather than toiling to gather resources. Two castes make up the majority of shimreen inhabitants: workers and warriors. Workers can have a variety of skilled occupations and include artisans, engineers, entertainers, and scientists. Warriors are mainly tasked with fending off attempted incursions from outsiders who covet the shimreens’ plentiful resources, though they are also skilled in hunting the wild creatures that survive unprotected in the planet’s harsh atmosphere.<br><br>The seven glowing cities of Shimrinsara are called the Jewels of Shimreen, and the largest of these is Kaniqlu, where elected representatives from each city form a council of seven that governs the planet. While most shimreens are fiercely protective of their home world, they do enjoy engaging in trade with other cultures so that they may learn and grow. During shimreen holidays, citizens gather to watch parades featuring several battalions of warriors, all performing intricate routines that are a mixture of elegant, flowing dance and ruthlessly lethal combat maneuvers.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Shimrinsara)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or geode

Squoxes are furry, vulpine animals roughly 2 feet in length and weighing around 15 pounds. They are quadrupedal, with five-fingered prehensile paws that have rotating wrists and ankles, allowing them to climb down surfaces headfirst like a squirrel. The creature’s other features are fox-like, including a flattened head with triangular ears, a pointed snout, and a bushy tail. Squox fur can come in hues of red orange, gray, fulvous, white, or brown, with white on the belly, neck, and tail tip. The species also has an array of fur patterns and environmental adaptations, such as long ears that allow desert-dwelling squoxes to disperse heat and thick seasonal fur and coloration for those accustomed to arctic regions.<br><br>Squoxes are among the most intelligent animal species in the Pact Worlds, exhibiting social behaviors and hierarchies along with a vast vocal repertoire. When confronted, squoxes are devious tacticians, especially in groups. They are clever enough to poke eyes, bite sensitive regions, and steal objects to bait enemies away from a den.<br><br>Although they originated on Castrovel, squoxes gained popularity across the Pact Worlds for their adorable features and ability to adapt to new environments. The people of Asana happily exported squoxes, which lashuntas see as pests. Over centuries, squoxes spread and successfully adjusted to biomes across the Pact Worlds. They’ve even begun to appear in the wild in the Veskarium and worlds in the Vast.<br><br>Xenowardens have tried to preserve the native squoxes of Castrovel while simultaneously curbing the incursion of the species into other ecologies. The group fears the invasive critters might irrevocably damage invaded ecosystems if left unchecked. Therefore, Xenowardens actively promote squox hunting on numerous worlds, as well as legal controls against importing the animals and releasing them into the wild.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Squox Pets</h2>\n<p>Squoxes are abundant across the Pact Worlds, breeding quickly and living for up to 10 years, or double that in captivity. Their intelligence and delightful appearance make them desirable companion animals, and they’re intelligent enough to be easily trained. Squoxes are also loyal, protective, charming, and entertaining, making them great companions for children. As clever and fun as they are, squoxes are also notorious for mischief, such as figuring out how to open cabinets and work simple machinery with the same aptitude as a very young sapient. They’ve even been known to clean up after themselves to hide thefts or accidents from their owners. Nevertheless, squoxes make great pets.<br><br>A squox kit can be purchased for 100 credits at 1 month old, just weaned from its mother. Untrained squoxes born as pets are usually domesticated and friendly but likely to misbehave without training. However, unscrupulous dealers gather squox kits in the wild and pass them off as domesticated, selling them at bargain prices. Squoxes reach adulthood by 10 months, and a fully trained adult squox goes for 400 credits.<br><br>A squox kit can be reared, or an older squox domesticated and trained, using the Survival skill, which takes 3 months. The squox’s inherent cleverness, curiosity, and friendliness grant its trainer a +2 circumstance bonus to Survival checks to rear or train it. A domesticated squox is friendly or helpful toward its trainer and any owner who treats it well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"framing\">Squox Gear</h2>\n<p>This item, known colloquially as a squox pocket, is available to PCs who want to protect their pets.

While it is in your space, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Bluff checks to feint.

Despite their terrifying appearance, shadow hoppers are generally peaceful and even quite playful. They spend the majority of their lives in their harmless-looking forms, which usually look like cuter and smaller versions of their standard shapes. Shadow hoppers prefer the company of other intelligent creatures and often dwell near rural settlements. While in their innocuous forms, some shadow hoppers allow people to “adopt” them as pets, though this usually ends in aggravation for that family, as shadow hoppers are inveterate tricksters.<br><br>Shadow hoppers enjoy playing pranks and causing general mischief: moving objects while no one is looking, taking small bites out of others’ food, telepathically whispering secrets to those around them, and occasionally sabotaging electronic devices. Their shenanigans are not typically meant to cause harm, but an overexcited shadow hopper can easily get carried away, especially when two or more work together to incite chaos. Sometimes, groups of shadow hoppers will gather to try to cause as much mischief and mayhem as they can in one night. Largely, though, shadow hoppers tend to be solitary creatures and don’t like to settle in areas where another shadow hopper already lives.<br><br>Scholars argue whether shadow hoppers are originally from the First World or the Shadow Plane, as they exhibit traits common to both fey and beings of shadow. Some believe shadow hoppers began their existence in one of these locations and somehow migrated to the other before coming to the Material Plane. Most shadow hoppers, however, refuse to speculate on their origins.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or umbra (3-5)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Magical Beast","environment":"","cr":8,"xp":{"value":4800},"source":"3C03 pg. 60","subtype":"Shapechanger","aura":"Frightful Presence - 30 Ft.

Nestled within every apari’s exoskeleton is a mass of millions of writhing gray maggots, each no larger than a grain of rice. A constant stream of chemical signals, ferried by the living neurological system of the apari, directs the development of these maggots into the myriad forms needed both to support the hive’s gestalt biological functions and to maintain a flexible population of individual bugs, each of which has an extremely specialized role. Aparis can be found on multiple worlds with various climates throughout the galaxy. So far no Pact Worlds entomologists have been able to trace their evolution back to a particular planet, though the fossil record seems to indicate that their original diaspora must have happened well before the Gap. A few fringe theories posit that aparis are progenitors of the Swarm, though this claim is contentious at best. How the unintelligent creatures might have traveled between solar systems is anyone’s guess: some scholars believe they were deliberately seeded as livestock by a spacefaring race, others theorize they may have been placed there by planar travelers (likely insectile spellcasters from the city of Axis), and still others think they are the deliberately devolved children of a spacefaring race that chose regression into unthinking beings rather than face some species-wide threat or existential quandary.<br><br>Aparis quickly become a formidable force in almost any ecosystem to which they are introduced. Their constituents can forage for food (usually rotting vegetable material or carrion), while the hive itself hunts animals. Perhaps most disconcerting is when the two methods combine, with the apari tearing into a beast while its constituents stream into the wounds and devour it from the inside out. Additionally, aparis’ considerable mutability provides them protection from threats that would seriously endanger more sedentary collective species, such as flooding or an intelligent competitor’s targeted attempts at extermination.<br><br>When the resources available to a single apari permit it to create more constituents than its body can efficiently support, it travels to a location in the center of its feeding territory and becomes temporarily stationary. Some of its constituents burrow into the ground beneath it and begin ferrying portions of the parent apari’s key biological systems—including half of its maggot core—while others continue to forage in the surrounding area to provide a steady stream of nutrients to the nascent hive. When the new hive is ready, the two aparis split the current hunting ground and expand the territories outward from that core, never explicitly working together but also not directly competing. Additionally, these aparis remain chemically linked, so that if disaster befalls one of them, surviving constituents can potentially join a linked hive and continue to thrive. In this way, entire planets have fallen to supercolonies of aparis whose influence spread across continents. Despite their mysterious presence on a variety of worlds, including both Triaxus and the insect moon of Nchak, aparis in the modern era are unable to colonize new worlds without an intelligent race to assist them. Fortunately for them, fried apari grubs are a delicacy in many Pact Worlds cultures, and attempts to hunt or ranch the creatures are dangerous but lucrative.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section

Squoxes are furry, vulpine animals roughly 2 feet in length and weighing around 15 pounds. They are quadrupedal, with five-fingered prehensile paws that have rotating wrists and ankles, allowing them to climb down surfaces headfirst like a squirrel. The creature’s other features are fox-like, including a flattened head with triangular ears, a pointed snout, and a bushy tail. Squox fur can come in hues of red orange, gray, fulvous, white, or brown, with white on the belly, neck, and tail tip. The species also has an array of fur patterns and environmental adaptations, such as long ears that allow desert-dwelling squoxes to disperse heat and thick seasonal fur and coloration for those accustomed to arctic regions.<br><br>Squoxes are among the most intelligent animal species in the Pact Worlds, exhibiting social behaviors and hierarchies along with a vast vocal repertoire. When confronted, squoxes are devious tacticians, especially in groups. They are clever enough to poke eyes, bite sensitive regions, and steal objects to bait enemies away from a den.<br><br>Although they originated on Castrovel, squoxes gained popularity across the Pact Worlds for their adorable features and ability to adapt to new environments. The people of Asana happily exported squoxes, which lashuntas see as pests. Over centuries, squoxes spread and successfully adjusted to biomes across the Pact Worlds. They’ve even begun to appear in the wild in the Veskarium and worlds in the Vast.<br><br>Xenowardens have tried to preserve the native squoxes of Castrovel while simultaneously curbing the incursion of the species into other ecologies. The group fears the invasive critters might irrevocably damage invaded ecosystems if left unchecked. Therefore, Xenowardens actively promote squox hunting on numerous worlds, as well as legal controls against importing the animals and releasing them into the wild.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Squox Pets</h2>\n<p>Squoxes are abundant across the Pact Worlds, breeding quickly and living for up to 10 years, or double that in captivity. Their intelligence and delightful appearance make them desirable companion animals, and they’re intelligent enough to be easily trained. Squoxes are also loyal, protective, charming, and entertaining, making them great companions for children. As clever and fun as they are, squoxes are also notorious for mischief, such as figuring out how to open cabinets and work simple machinery with the same aptitude as a very young sapient. They’ve even been known to clean up after themselves to hide thefts or accidents from their owners. Nevertheless, squoxes make great pets.<br><br>A squox kit can be purchased for 100 credits at 1 month old, just weaned from its mother. Untrained squoxes born as pets are usually domesticated and friendly but likely to misbehave without training. However, unscrupulous dealers gather squox kits in the wild and pass them off as domesticated, selling them at bargain prices. Squoxes reach adulthood by 10 months, and a fully trained adult squox goes for 400 credits.<br><br>A squox kit can be reared, or an older squox domesticated and trained, using the Survival skill, which takes 3 months. The squox’s inherent cleverness, curiosity, and friendliness grant its trainer a +2 circumstance bonus to Survival checks to rear or train it.

While your squox companion is within 30 feet of you, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Perception checks to notice and search when the GM determines your squox could help you accomplish these tasks.<br><br>Your Tiny squox companion can share your space and end its movement there. Outside your space, your squox has evasion, as the operative class feature. While in your space, your squox has evasion, improved evasion (as the operative exploit), and cover. In addition, when your squox is adjacent to you or in your space and would take damage, you can use your reaction to intercede and take the damage instead.<br><br>In addition, your adorable companion is distracting. While it is in your space, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Bluff checks to feint. If your squox is in your space or within 10 feet of you, you can instead gain this insight bonus to Bluff checks to create a diversion, which can allow you or your squox to attempt to hide (your choice of which when you attempt the Bluff check).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or skulk

Their cybernetics seem to twist their flesh, even splitting it open in places to expose muscle and bone. Most heretics have dark leather plates sutured onto their flesh while pitted iron masks with holes for eyes are riveted onto their faces. Heretics integrate their weapons into their bodies; usually, one arm is replaced by a velstrac flenser, and a laser rifle is attached to a shoulder on an articulated chassis, allowing the weapon to pivot in all directions.<br><br>To other velstracs, heretics are seen as crude butchers lacking finesse and subtlety. Heretics consider the consensual exchange of pain to be the weakest form of torture and despise it for its lack of true danger, preferring to engage in what they refer to as “vital combat” with their victims. It is rare to find a heretic on its own, as they tend to form close-knit bands that seek out intruders to the Shadow Plane and deliver righteous pain unto them.<br><br>Once every few centuries, a velstrac demagogue reveals themself to a platoon of heretics and charges them with a vital “holy mission” that involves the outsiders traveling to a world on the Material Plane and cleansing it of all life. These targets aren’t chosen randomly; they are usually ones inhabited by sentient creatures whose souls are mostly stained with corruption and whose deaths will create more velstracs.</p>\n<h2>Vestrac</h2>\n<p>ometimes called “kytons” by mortals, velstracs are cruel fiends who dwell on the Shadow Plane. Each velstrac seeks to unlock its highest potential by following a path of methodical, self-inflicted pain while also psychically feeding on the fear and anguish of mortal creatures. Velstracs care only for this path of pain and its mystical destination; they see “lesser” beings as nothing more than stepping-stones for their own ascension.<br><br>Transformation requires a velstrac to excise pieces of itself, spiritually and physically. Dross is cut away and replaced with grafts—artificial or natural, flesh or spirit, magical or technological. Each graft brings the velstrac closer to its ideal state and increases its power. In this practice, velstracs are more fanatical than even the Augmented are about cybernetic augmentations. The emotions and pain experienced during each step, they believe, cause spiritual evolution.<br><br>Legend holds that the first velstracs emerged when mortals conceived of cruelty as an acceptable means of personal advancement. The goodly gods, astonished and dismayed, chained the velstracs in Hell. However, instead of struggling against their bonds, the velstracs subsumed their chains and eventually escaped into the Shadow Plane.<br><br>Velstracs leave the Shadow Plane to prey on sentient creatures. They maintain installations and portals in dark locales, launching forays into the Material Plane from such places. Most mortals who fall into velstrac clutches are doomed to live out the remainder of their days—or minutes—in agony. However, such mortals can sometimes become velstracs themselves. The supposed methods of this shift differ wildly, but all involve terrible suffering that only escalates after the transformation is complete. These newest velstracs often become anchorites, fiendish ascetics devoted to the torment of themselves as much as of others. An anchorite’s first act must be to willingly mutilate its flesh, showing its dedication to the velstrac way.<br><br>Anchorites are among the lowest-ranking fiends in the velstrac hierarchy. Often working in pairs or squads, they are crafters, gophers, and soldiers. Anchorite labor produces the majority of velstrac equipment, from their starships to their hide armors with inward-pointing studs and spikes. Anchorites take pains to make their creations macabre and ornate. These velstracs also make up the rank and file of velstrac exploration teams and starship crews.<br><br>In battle, anchorites aim to inflict maximum amounts of delicious agony upon themselves and their foes. Sharing pain is an ecstasy to anchorites as they guide each other along the path of evolution. Few velstracs of any sort refuse to telepathically pair with an anchorite and at least taste its pain, and it’s a rare and disgraceful act for an anchorite to refuse to share with another. A stronger velstrac who takes advantage of an anchorite to survive an otherwise deadly conflict is not considered to be acting dishonorably because in velstrac doctrine, the weak exist to serve the needs of the mighty. All velstracs answer to the demands of their strongest, the velstrac demagogues.</p>\n<h2>Velstrac Starships</h2>\n<p>A clear hierarchy commands all velstrac groupings, including the fiends’ starfaring forces. The velstracs’ fast and sleek&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonsrd.com/Starship_Examples.aspx?ItemName=Velstrac%20Corvette&amp;Family=Velstrac%20Starships\">corvettes</a>&nbsp;serve as heavy scouts and raiders, cutting into enemy territory and fleets like serrated blades. In starship combat, corvette crews fight as they would in personal combat, with the aim to deal maximum damage as brutally as possible. After strafing disabled ships with chain cannons, corvettes usually make boarding maneuvers to take prisoners. Corvette anchorite crews have even been known to use their escape pods as ballistic weapons against ships with weakened defenses, hoping to overcome those defenses and, perhaps, to improvise boarding at the same time.</p>\n<h2>Velstrac Flensers</h2>\n<p>Velstracs wield&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonsrd.com/WeaponDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Ascetic&amp;Family=Velstrac%20Flenser\">flensers</a>—blades designed to slice skin from muscle and muscle from bone—sometimes mounting these knives on rifles as bayonets. Flensers are honed to supernatural sharpness and powered to vibrate with the rhythms of the wielder’s body.

The table above shows an array of flensers, which can be purchased only in the darkest corners of the galaxy.</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Shadow Plane)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>section (2-5), squad (6-12), or platoon (13-25)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Outsider (evil,extraplanar, lawful, velstrac)","environment":"","cr":8,"xp":{"value":4800},"source":"AP #12 (p 60)","subtype":"Evil, Extraplanar, Lawful, Velstrac","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":"Unnerving gaze - 30 ft.

The longing turns to anger as life slips away, but the varculak’s will is strong enough that the soul doesn’t pass on into the River of Souls for Pharasma’s judgment. Instead, a portion of the mortal essence passes away, leaving behind a soul with little memory of who it once was, and locked inside a halfliving body. What remains is grim determination and rage. Among occult scholars, this state is known as “the Curse of Varcul.” The legendary first varculak, once a human named Varcul, supposedly existed thousands of years before the Gap. Some say he still does, and varculaks make a deal with him to continue living—a bargain they don’t remember.<br><br>A varculak looks much as they did in life, except limbs and sensory organs outside the human norm wither away and turn to dust. Lashuntas, for example, lose their antennae, while kasathas lose their extra arms and strix lose their wings. (Some speculate this effect is related to the fabled Varcul and his erstwhile humanity, or he requires his “offspring” to make these sacrifices.) Eyes undergo a notable change, the orbs giving way to points of cold light, which can be of any hue. Except for this alteration, a varculak who has eaten or rested recently can look almost alive, but becomes pale and drawn quickly between periods of refreshment, and varculaks never look so much like corpses as when they sleep. These changes prevent them from passing for a normal member of any humanoid species.<br><br>Most varculaks are creatures of deep passion. They have a sense of life as fleeting, and they seek not only to experience what it has to offer, but also to give it purpose. Varculaks are rarely idle. If anything, they can be obsessive and, having died once, are averse to fewer risks than the living. A lucky few remember some important task they left unfinished in their previous life and make that their purpose. In this way, many varculaks end up reintegrating with the society that death temporarily separated them from.<br><br>Some varculaks, however, remember only the circumstances of their death. This one recollection can lead a varculak who died violently to focus on vengeance, seeking those responsible. That done, a varculak can become obsessed with the chain of blame, condemning nearly anyone for even a tenuous connection to the varculak’s death. If a mercenary killed such a varculak, the undead seeks first that mercenary, then the mercenary’s entire company, then those who hired the mercenary, and eventually even those responsible for the conflict that led to the varculak’s demise or the manufacturer of the weapon the mercenary used for the deed. A varculak on such a path of destruction is more likely to face a second and final death than to reach the path’s end.</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Undead","environment":"","cr":12,"xp":{"value":19200},"source":"AA 3 (p 126)","raceAndGrafts":"Varculak envoy","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":22,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":27,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":22,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":27,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":22,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":22,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"small","senses":"darkvision 60 ft.","languages":{"value":["akiton","common","eoxian","shirren","ysoki"],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":"Deathless Weakness; Silver Susceptibility"},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{"sfrpg":{"conditions":[]}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Varculak Noble","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"jAe8acmWo7QqmAhx","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"FDA5XvhKPz9pCpdq","flags":{},"name":"Deathless Vitality (Ex)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"Varculaks are immune to disease, and they neither breathe nor suffer the normal environmental effects of being in a vacuum.

Originally native to the Parapet Mountains on Triaxus, wollipeds were among the first animals the ryphorians domesticated. On Triaxus, ryphorians have raised wollipeds as livestock for thousands of years. With the advent of Drift travel, however, wollipeds have spread to other planets beyond the Pact Worlds.<br><br>In the wild, wollipeds are herd animals. When threatened, they gather in a tight cluster, adults on the outside with their tusks facing outward, and the young and infirm herd members protected in the center. Wollipeds also spit as a defense mechanism. They developed spiting to warn off competitors for choice food. However, if attacked or sufficiently upset, a wolliped vomits the half-digested contents of its stomach to scare off attackers. Wolliped defensive clusters rain this spit on would-be attackers, often driving off all but the hardiest of predators.<br><br>On Triaxus, herds of wild wollipeds migrate great distances during the planet’s harsh winters in search of food. Most wollipeds are herbivores. Those dwelling in high altitudes or areas with sparse vegetation feed on lichens, mosses, and tubers. Wollipeds of the plains graze on grasses and leaves.<br><br>Like ryphorians, wollipeds have adapted to Triaxus’s long seasons, regardless of what planet they inhabit. Wollipeds born in the winter (Triaxus’s current season) have long, thick, shaggy coats. Those born in the summer have shorter, thinner coats. Winterborn wollipeds grow much longer tusks than their summerborn kindred, using them to dig into the ice and snow for burmoss, roots and rhizomes, tubers, and patches of sentient tulbos fungus. All wollipeds also clash their tusks in dominance competitions and mating displays.<br><br>Wollipeds are exceptionally surefooted, able to easily climb steep mountain trails and maneuver in deep snow. This ability to navigate challenging environments, as well as their docile nature, made wollipeds a natural choice for domestication. Of greatest value is the wollipeds’ fleece, which can be spun and woven into warm, water-repellent textiles. Wollipeds are also raised for their meat, and some ryphorians drink a potent alcohol made from fermented wolliped milk for traditional celebrations and rituals. Wollipeds also make fine mounts and beasts of burden.<br><br>Herds of domesticated wollipeds can be found all over Triaxus, from the Allied Territories to Ning. Most are raised for their fleece, but more than half of Triaxus’s domesticated wolliped production goes to feeding the population of the Drakelands. The same traits that led to the domestication of wollipeds on Triaxus have made them valuable as hardy livestock on cold or mountainous colony worlds. In a pinch, colonists can use them for physical labor, just as the ryphorians did in pre-Gap times.<br><br>A typical wolliped is about 12 feet long from nose to base of tail, stands 5 feet tall at the front shoulder, and weighs around 3,000 pounds. Wollipeds mate annually and give birth after 11 months. Most wollipeds live for about 15 years.</p>\n<h2>Regional Variants</h2>\n<p>The wolliped statistics represent the most common breed native to Triaxus, but other breeds exist across the world. These beasts are available off-world as well.<br><br>Alural:&nbsp;Ryphorian tribes of the Alural Plains in the Drakelands have long bred the strongest and most aggressive wollipeds. They start with the only known carnivorous strain of wollipeds, which aren’t docile like their herbivorous kin. Alural trainers then prepare the wollipeds for riders and war. For those who prefer the ancient tradition of riding a wolliped into battle, this variety is widely regarded as the best. The alural war wolliped statistics represent a combat-trained, armored wolliped. A wild alural is like a normal wolliped, but it lacks the docile weakness.<br><br>Ningese:&nbsp;The island continent Ning on Triaxus is home to a small breed of wolliped, known for its hardiness, speed, and agility. Ningese wolliped fleece is fine and soft, and the animals’ tender meat is considered a delicacy on Triaxus. Both are rare luxuries elsewhere, because the Immortal Suzerainty of Ning claims independence from the Pact Worlds, and Ning’s exports carry severe tariffs and shipping restrictions. Ningese wollipeds have the miniature simple template, Strength +2 (1d6+5 B damage for their gore), Dexterity and initiative +4, and their speed is 60 feet.</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>cold hills, mountains, or plains (Triaxus)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or herd

Their two lower limbs are robust, capable of clinging to jagged surfaces for extended periods, while their forelimbs bear dozens of long, fibrous whiskers that fan out like baleen to catch passing food particles. These forelimbs each also bear a set of three grasping claws, with which a wrikreechee can manipulate objects, tools, and weapons.<br><br>Wrikreechees are natives of Akchios, a lonely, watery planet with a fairly eccentric orbit around an orange main-sequence star. Over much of its existence, Akchios was covered in ice miles thick, melting only partly every 3 years when the planet drew closer to the sun. Fairly simple life developed in its concealed oceans, feeding upon nutrients surging from deep-sea vents. Only a modest range of more complex life-forms evolved in the lightless depths, and among these were the wrikreechees: soft-bodied organisms who developed rigid exoskeletons that allowed them to wander and feed during the warming cycle. During the cooling cycle, they molted their shells and retreated into coral-like constructions to conserve energy and socialize with their wintering colony. As best as modern scholars can tell, their kind evolved self-awareness and higher thought processes as a direct extension of this communal living. Though the species developed only rudimentary technologies in the absence of fire and metallurgy, their cultural love of history, mathematics, and philosophy made them a highly educated people.<br><br>For the past 100,000 years, Akchios’s sun has grown hotter, melting more and more of the planet’s icy shell. Several centuries before the Gap, Akchios thawed enough to expose its immense ocean, revealing the cosmos to the wrikreechees for the first time. They had already developed complex astronomic theories by the time Pact Worlds explorers arrived 50 years ago, and although the wrikreechees still had only simple tools, they had the academic aptitude to quickly understand and adopt the visitors’ technologies. While still fairly uncommon beyond their home world, traveling wrikreechee scholars and engineers are renowned for creating wonders of architecture and adapting old technologies in innovative ways.<br><br>Among the wrikreechees’ most important developments are a swath of pharmaceuticals and inexpensive biotech solutions that have helped them adapt to life in dry environments. Most importantly, these include a series of hormonal enhancements that allow a wrikreechee to maintain its shell year round and a biotech vocal enhancer that helps the creature project its voice and enunciate at near-human levels- without which a wrikreechee’s simple jaw and throat mangle a range of consonants and can barely project above a whisper in air. Much of the Wrikreechee language is conveyed through arm movements and chirps, with entire syntactic structures expressed solely through vibrations felt only over short distances in the water. These grammatical constructions are reserved primarily for terms of endearment, trust, and understanding. As a result, wrikreechees emit a nearly inaudible buzz around dear friends, and they find communication over comm units distressingly sterile.<br><br>Temperature fluctuations remain the bane of most wrikreechees; because of their adaptation to seasonal stimuli, they become noticeably torpid in cold weather, and heat can spur practically manic bouts of energy. Those who can afford to do so wear suits with environmental controls to maintain their body temperatures-and prevent any mood swings that would otherwise result. Most wrikreechee travelers delight in clothing and crowded rooms, finding both to be suitable replacements for the colonies they left behind.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any aquatic or urban (Akchios)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, fixture (2-7), colony (8-20)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Monstrous Humanoid (aquatic)","environment":"","cr":3,"xp":{"value":800},"source":"AA 1 (p 124)","subtype":"Aquatic","raceAndGrafts":"Wrikreechee envoy","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":8,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":13,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":13,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":8,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":8,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":13,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro1":{"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"value":0,"misc":16,"ranks":0,"ability":"str","subname":"swimming","mod":16,"enabled":true}},"traits":{"size":"medium","senses":"darkvision 60 ft.","languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":"Wrikreechee"},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{"sfrpg":{"conditions":[]}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Wrikreechee","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"kcnePvbBOlsbl3bU","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{},"bar2":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"Y20O3lX9fuZJLSO1","flags":{},"name":"Sheltering (Ex)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"A wrikreechee instinctively knows how to exploit sources of cover.

Rather than being a bloody mess, however, its flesh is dull and gray. A cantor’s glossy black eyes burn red when the creature becomes violent or uses its vile powers.<br><br>A cantor velstrac is a fiend that uses its horrific appearance as a weapon. It considers itself to be an instrument in an ongoing effort to help mortals accept the velstrac notion of reality-that pain is a tool of self-exploration and development. Cantors pursue this end through subterfuge and by aiding other velstracs as scouts.</p>\n<h2>Velstrac</h2>\n<p>Sometimes called “kytons” by mortals, velstracs are cruel fiends who dwell on the Shadow Plane. Each velstrac seeks to unlock its highest potential by following a path of methodical, self-inflicted pain while also psychically feeding on the fear and anguish of mortal creatures. Velstracs care only for this path of pain and its mystical destination; they see “lesser” beings as nothing more than stepping-stones for their own ascension.<br><br>Transformation requires a velstrac to excise pieces of itself, spiritually and physically. Dross is cut away and replaced with grafts—artificial or natural, flesh or spirit, magical or technological. Each graft brings the velstrac closer to its ideal state and increases its power. In this practice, velstracs are more fanatical than even the Augmented are about cybernetic augmentations. The emotions and pain experienced during each step, they believe, cause spiritual evolution.<br><br>Legend holds that the first velstracs emerged when mortals conceived of cruelty as an acceptable means of personal advancement. The goodly gods, astonished and dismayed, chained the velstracs in Hell. However, instead of struggling against their bonds, the velstracs subsumed their chains and eventually escaped into the Shadow Plane.<br><br>Velstracs leave the Shadow Plane to prey on sentient creatures. They maintain installations and portals in dark locales, launching forays into the Material Plane from such places. Most mortals who fall into velstrac clutches are doomed to live out the remainder of their days—or minutes—in agony. However, such mortals can sometimes become velstracs themselves. The supposed methods of this shift differ wildly, but all involve terrible suffering that only escalates after the transformation is complete. These newest velstracs often become anchorites, fiendish ascetics devoted to the torment of themselves as much as of others. An anchorite’s first act must be to willingly mutilate its flesh, showing its dedication to the velstrac way.<br><br>Anchorites are among the lowest-ranking fiends in the velstrac hierarchy. Often working in pairs or squads, they are crafters, gophers, and soldiers. Anchorite labor produces the majority of velstrac equipment, from their starships to their hide armors with inward-pointing studs and spikes. Anchorites take pains to make their creations macabre and ornate. These velstracs also make up the rank and file of velstrac exploration teams and starship crews.<br><br>In battle, anchorites aim to inflict maximum amounts of delicious agony upon themselves and their foes. Sharing pain is an ecstasy to anchorites as they guide each other along the path of evolution. Few velstracs of any sort refuse to telepathically pair with an anchorite and at least taste its pain, and it’s a rare and disgraceful act for an anchorite to refuse to share with another. A stronger velstrac who takes advantage of an anchorite to survive an otherwise deadly conflict is not considered to be acting dishonorably because in velstrac doctrine, the weak exist to serve the needs of the mighty. All velstracs answer to the demands of their strongest, the velstrac demagogues.</p>\n<h2>Velstrac Starships</h2>\n<p>A clear hierarchy commands all velstrac groupings, including the fiends’ starfaring forces. The velstracs’ fast and sleek&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonsrd.com/Starship_Examples.aspx?ItemName=Velstrac%20Corvette&amp;Family=Velstrac%20Starships\">corvettes</a>&nbsp;serve as heavy scouts and raiders, cutting into enemy territory and fleets like serrated blades. In starship combat, corvette crews fight as they would in personal combat, with the aim to deal maximum damage as brutally as possible. After strafing disabled ships with chain cannons, corvettes usually make boarding maneuvers to take prisoners. Corvette anchorite crews have even been known to use their escape pods as ballistic weapons against ships with weakened defenses, hoping to overcome those defenses and, perhaps, to improvise boarding at the same time.</p>\n<h2>Velstrac Flensers</h2>\n<p>Velstracs wield&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonsrd.com/WeaponDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Ascetic&amp;Family=Velstrac%20Flenser\">flensers</a>—blades designed to slice skin from muscle and muscle from bone—sometimes mounting these knives on rifles as bayonets. Flensers are honed to supernatural sharpness and powered to vibrate with the rhythms of the wielder’s body. Velstracs have mastered the art of using these advanced melee weapons to inflict wounds while keeping targets alive. The table above shows an array of flensers, which can be purchased only in the darkest corners of the galaxy.</p>\n<section>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Shadow Plane)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, expedition (3-6)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Outsider (evil, extraplanar, lawful, velstrac","environment":"","cr":9,"xp":{"value":6400},"source":"AP #10 (p 60)","subtype":"Evil, Extraplanar, Lawful, Velstrac","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":"Unnerving gaze - 30 ft.

Nestled within every apari’s exoskeleton is a mass of millions of writhing gray maggots, each no larger than a grain of rice. A constant stream of chemical signals, ferried by the living neurological system of the apari, directs the development of these maggots into the myriad forms needed both to support the hive’s gestalt biological functions and to maintain a flexible population of individual bugs, each of which has an extremely specialized role. Aparis can be found on multiple worlds with various climates throughout the galaxy. So far no Pact Worlds entomologists have been able to trace their evolution back to a particular planet, though the fossil record seems to indicate that their original diaspora must have happened well before the Gap. A few fringe theories posit that aparis are progenitors of the Swarm, though this claim is contentious at best. How the unintelligent creatures might have traveled between solar systems is anyone’s guess: some scholars believe they were deliberately seeded as livestock by a spacefaring race, others theorize they may have been placed there by planar travelers (likely insectile spellcasters from the city of Axis), and still others think they are the deliberately devolved children of a spacefaring race that chose regression into unthinking beings rather than face some species-wide threat or existential quandary.<br><br>Aparis quickly become a formidable force in almost any ecosystem to which they are introduced. Their constituents can forage for food (usually rotting vegetable material or carrion), while the hive itself hunts animals. Perhaps most disconcerting is when the two methods combine, with the apari tearing into a beast while its constituents stream into the wounds and devour it from the inside out. Additionally, aparis’ considerable mutability provides them protection from threats that would seriously endanger more sedentary collective species, such as flooding or an intelligent competitor’s targeted attempts at extermination.<br><br>When the resources available to a single apari permit it to create more constituents than its body can efficiently support, it travels to a location in the center of its feeding territory and becomes temporarily stationary. Some of its constituents burrow into the ground beneath it and begin ferrying portions of the parent apari’s key biological systems—including half of its maggot core—while others continue to forage in the surrounding area to provide a steady stream of nutrients to the nascent hive. When the new hive is ready, the two aparis split the current hunting ground and expand the territories outward from that core, never explicitly working together but also not directly competing. Additionally, these aparis remain chemically linked, so that if disaster befalls one of them, surviving constituents can potentially join a linked hive and continue to thrive. In this way, entire planets have fallen to supercolonies of aparis whose influence spread across continents. Despite their mysterious presence on a variety of worlds, including both Triaxus and the insect moon of Nchak, aparis in the modern era are unable to colonize new worlds without an intelligent race to assist them. Fortunately for them, fried apari grubs are a delicacy in many Pact Worlds cultures, and attempts to hunt or ranch the creatures are dangerous but lucrative.</span></p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>temperate or warm plains</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Vermin","environment":"","cr":7,"xp":{"value":3200},"source":"AA1 (pg. 14)","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":19,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":14,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":14,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":14,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"large","senses":"darkvision 60 ft.","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":"Critical Hits"},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":"Critical Hits"},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Apari","displayName":40,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":60,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"tflFTovrXqHWUoPJ","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"flags":{},"name":"Mutable (Ex)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"Virtually every part of an apari’s internal physiology can be effectively repaired or replaced at a moment’s notice as constituents rush to fill the needed role.

A race of machines left behind by eons-departed masters, these constructs developed the capacity for evolution and self-improvement, creating an entire mechanical ecosystem.<br><br>The most common design for anacites is a basic arthropodan form of silvery metal, with multiple legs for efficient travel and claws or manipulators for accomplishing their assigned tasks. Depending on their role, however, an anacite might be anything from a bulldozer-sized mining specialist to a floating electronic brain designed for advanced problem-solving, and even those anacites who fit the stereotypical metal-insect design usually have a modification or two, and almost all anacites can reconfigure parts of themselves to adapt to their circumstances.<br><br>In the uncounted millennia since the departure of the so-called “First Ones,” anacites have not been idle. The two primary factions of anacites, Those Who Wait and Those Who Become, have very different ideas of their purpose in life, yet the two are more alike than different. While they variously wait for the First Ones to return or work toward taking on their progenitors’ mantle, anacites endlessly strive to acquire wealth and influence in preparation for their great goal’s fulfillment.<br><br>While “anacite” officially refers only to the sentient varieties of Aballonian machines—those capable of learning and participating in Aballonian society—many offworlders use it as a catchall term for the world’s mechanical life. Dragonflylike wingbots are an example of Aballonian technobiology. These artificial creatures lack basic sentience yet nevertheless reproduce and fill one of the planet’s ecological niches. These 4-foot-long machines whir from ridge to ridge on wings glittering with solar panels, feeding on the blazing light of the sun. Wingbots can be territorial, and they occasionally attack offworlders or other anacites.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any

Their eyes are pure-black orbs, protruding from their heads in half domes like the eyes of a mouse, and they can change the pigment of their skin at will to have complex patterns. Nearly all verthani learn to control these color changes by the time they reach puberty, but babies and children display bright, expressive patterns and colors that reflect their current mood. Some adults also refuse to control them, seeing in their random patterns hints of prophecy.<br><br>Long ago, verthani society was split into three castes: the Augmented, the Pure Ones, and the God-Vessels. A verthani’s caste is chosen during adolescence. Though few verthani today bind themselves strictly by the system’s rules, the traditions still carry a measure of cultural pride, and some verthani proudly wear the labels.<br><br>The Augmented are verthani who modify their bodies with technology, usually cybernetic augmentations. This caste was particularly popular with those who piloted early aetherships (the elegant vessels verthani first sailed through the stars), and Augmented verthani pilots are still renowned as some of the most skilled in the Pact Worlds.<br><br>In contrast, Pure Ones traditionally eschewed all technological augmentation and were responsible for supporting other castes, farming, and governing. While many modern Pure Ones have accepted at least some modest cybernetic or biotech improvements to their bodies, these verthani remain proud of their traditional caretaker roles.<br><br>God-Vessels serve faithfully as living avatars of their deities, displaying this status by branding holy symbols called devotionals into their chests using either acid or flame. God-Vessels never cover up these distinctive marks, despite the fact that the scar tissue around them never fully heals and can no longer change color.<br><br>Verthani culture is a model of independent, democratic cooperation. Forced to live on a cramped sliver of their planet, surrounded by nearly inhospitable lands on either side, verthani learned how to work together without violence or subjugation, and they choose to harness technology to increase resources rather than battle one another over scraps. Verces’s Ring of Nations remains a shining example of a one-world government in which citizens remain protected yet free to go their own way, and in many ways the Pact Worlds system itself was directly inspired by this aspect of verthani culture.</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Verces)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or squad (3-8)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Humanoid","environment":"","cr":2,"xp":{"value":600},"source":"AA 1 (p 118)","subtype":"Verthani","raceAndGrafts":"Verthani operative","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":13,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":8,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":8,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":8,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":16,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":13,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"medium","senses":"low-light vision","languages":{"value":["common","vercite"],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{"sfrpg":{"conditions":[]}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Verthani Aether Pilot","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"TKPLZf2oVteaxZ9n","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"chBLdweyUsmv5Gim","flags":{},"name":"Evasion (Ex) (Operative)","type":"feat","img":"systems/sfrpg/icons/classes/evasion.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>&gt;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.classes\" data-id=\"uf8ADOAeBrtUkPVl\" draggable=\"true\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Operative</a></p>\n        <p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\">If you succeed at a Reflex save against an effect that normally has a partial effect on a successful save, you instead suffer no effect.

Created by a vanished race of plane-hopping aliens to serve as their mounts, xanthoi still exhibit the natural curiosity and teleporting capabilities of their absentee masters. Their capacity for effortless travel and their drive to observe, collect, and catalogue knowledge give them a long history as field researchers, but the end of the Gap marked a drastic shift in xanthos mindsets. While other species despaired at the collective loss of so much history, the xanthoi celebrate the Gap as the period of their masters’ return. They believe their creators utilized powerful magic or technology to compile all accumulated information in the universe, taking a large chunk of it with them when they again departed at the end of the Gap. They celebrate this erasure as an opportunity to learn anew, free from the misconceptions of the past, and proselytize the inevitable return of their masters, whom they believe will bring about a second Gap.<br/><br/>Understanding that their masters have already collected the “old knowings” that they and others have gathered throughout history, xanthoi now focus their acute observational skills on current events of all sorts. They seek to understand and document everything from political upheavals and interstellar wars to fashion trends and technological advances. Grand celestial occurrences and the final scores of local sporting events captivate them equally, and every moment of their wandering lives is recorded and uploaded into local infospheres. These firsthand accounts often gain popularity on social networks and news outlets, with the famed impartiality of the xanthoi making them ideal-if somewhat dry and

Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.<br><br><strong>Familiarity:</strong> “Very familiar” describes a place you have been very often and where you feel at home. “Studied carefully” describes a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or because you’ve been there often. “Seen casually” describes a place you have been to more than once but with which you are not very familiar. “Viewed once” describes a place you have seen once in person or have extensively studied through scrying magic, remote cameras, or recorded images (for a remote-viewed location, you still need to have a clear idea of the location; you can’t teleport to an unknown location that you’ve seen in a holovid).<br><br>“False destination” describes a place that doesn’t truly exist, or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location, it is a place that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.<br><br><strong>On Target:</strong> You appear where you want to be.<br><br><strong>Off Target:</strong> You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. The distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.<br><br><strong>Similar Area:</strong> You wind up in an area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range.

They have a unique outlook: individualistic without being anarchic, and somehow unable (or perhaps unwilling) to grasp the concept of permanent governance. They understand and enjoy teamwork, and naturally follow a qualified leader to undertake large projects such as the building of domiciles, but once that task has been completed, the leader doesn’t continue to hold sway over the others. Coupled with their unusual life cycle, it would seem as if skittermanders would be very difficult to rule. But such is not exactly the case.<br><br>When vesk warships appeared in the sky, skittermanders across Vesk-3 were more than happy to get out of the invaders’ way—not out of fear, but more because of their innate desire to help. Skittermanders instinctively recognized the Veskarium’s superior strength and felt they could best aid the empire by simply not being in the same location as its soldiers. In this way, skittermanders believed the vesk could quickly achieve their goals and move on. They didn’t understand the vesk’s aim was to subdue their world. Since vesk’s code of honor forbade them from shooting the cheerfully acquiescent skittermanders in the back, the invaders were confused and infuriated by the situation.<br><br>Eventually, in a meeting that the empire notes as the official date that Vesk-3 was conquered, a vesk general plainly told a group of skittermanders that the Veskarium ruled their planet. The skittermanders nodded and got back to their lives. Since then, the empire has ruled Vesk-3, though it hasn’t truly been in control of it. Skittermanders cheerfully accept jobs given to them by vesk, but never truly acknowledge the vesk as being in charge. Some outside the Veskarium believe skittermanders are being deliberately obtuse, reaping all the technological and social benefits the empire offers while still partially maintaining their freedom as a society, but no skittermander has ever confirmed this theory.<br><br>Today, skittermanders can be found throughout the Veskarium, often serving in clerical positions that allow them to aid as many people as possible. They have fully embraced technology and enjoy the many sights the galaxy has to offer, traveling to the Pact Worlds and beyond. Those who employ skittermanders quickly learn to give them missions that have open-ended parameters, as a skittermander who feels she has completed a task won’t necessarily report back to a superior for further instructions if she finds someone else who needs her help first. Outsiders often find them cheerfully manic, noting a goblin-like flair for the ridiculous but none of that race’s innate malice.<br><br>Though skittermanders are mammals, they begin life in something akin to a larval stage. A skittermander whelp looks like a miniature version of an adult, but with more prominent ears and a tiny, secondary mouth on its abdomen. Once born, whelps are left to fend for themselves. They are truly omnivorous, capable of digesting fruits, leaves, raw meat, and seeds. Additionally, a whelp’s secondary mouth allows it to attach itself to large prey and feed at its leisure. Thanks to a numbing mucus secreted by this mouth, less intelligent animals rarely even notice the whelp’s samplings. A swarm of skittermander whelps has been known to bring down a trundling bovine monoux in a matter of minutes.<br><br>After 6 years, whelps mature into adult skittermanders, begin to walk upright, and lose their secondary mouths, but they maintain their taste for anything remotely edible. Skittermanders living in tropical climes have short, soft fur, while their arctic cousins grow tough, shaggy hair. Their coloration varies even more, with tones of blue, green, and violet being the most common, but with no obvious correlation to their surroundings.<br><br>The average adult skittermander is 3 feet tall and weighs about 35 pounds.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Vesk-3)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or mob (3-12)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Humanoid","environment":"","cr":2,"xp":{"value":600},"source":"AA1 pg. 106","subtype":"Skittermander","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":7,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":12,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":12,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":7,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":12,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":7,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"small","senses":"low-light vision","languages":{"value":["common","vesk"],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Skittermander","displayName":40,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"Rn8LSLUVEdzPQ0Mc","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"flags":{},"name":"Flame doshko, ember","type":"weapon","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>When activated, the blade of this doshko heats up by means of internal heating coils.

Jaws that function like grinders and glands at the bases of their many spines that exude acid to liquefy rock allow these wormlike creatures to create labyrinthine tunnels in their domains, through which they can move with uncanny speed. The color of a surnoch’s hide is similar to that of the rock it burrows through. A typical surnoch is 15 feet long and weighs over 1,200 pounds.<br><br>At its leading end, a surnoch has a deep funnel of a mouth lined with numerous small orifices. At the back of the funnel is the grasping jaw with which it brings material into the funnel to be sorted. While the grasping jaw looks ferocious, the real danger of the maw lies in the fact that it is essentially a giant, churning mining machine.<br><br>The numerous small orifices that line the interior of a surnoch’s mouth allow matter of different consistencies to stream through as the creature chews and melts its way through rock and stone. Nutrientrich material is routed to the surnoch’s digestive tract, while much of the rest of it is broken down into various acids by the surnoch’s caustrolizer system, a series of organs unique to the creature that act like a chemical factory. A surnoch has an innate sense of which minerals its body requires the most of and has evolved a kind of X-ray vision that it allows it to find these foodstuffs, even through several feet of rock.<br><br>After consuming some of its favored elements, a surnoch excretes condensed and hardened forms of the minerals it can neither digest nor turn into acid. A feeding surnoch leaves tunnels full of strange alloys and amalgams in its wake, some which can’t be created through any other process. The castings that line a surnoch tunnel have an ethereal, shimmering beauty, like mother-of-pearl arranged in strange symmetries. Many of the endemic alloys are useful to the technological races of the Pact Worlds, so occasional expeditions purposefully seek out asteroids mined by surnochs to harvest the beasts’ unusual leavings. The greatest connoisseurs of these castings are the sarcesians, who turn the beautiful substances into jewelry and elaborate sculptures.<br><br>Approaching surnoch territory to harvest such material, or for any other reason, is incredibly dangerous. Surnochs aren’t territorial but they are ravenous. Almost any technology that can transport a visitor to a surnoch-infested asteroid contains the elements that a surnoch consumes. While powered armor and electronic items are the most likely to draw hungry surnochs, most refined material has a reasonable chance of looking like dinner. Those who make their livings harvesting surnoch castings primarily use equipment created from materials that have already been vetted as uninteresting to the creatures.<br><br>Surnochs are found mainly in the asteroids of the Diaspora and in the larger rocks of the Liavaran rings, fully sorting and digesting them before drifting through space to the next host. Surnochs are sometimes seen on small moons across the Pact Worlds, especially the shepherd moons of Liavara, and the discovery of surnoch remains on larger moons has given scientists a fairly precise understanding of how much gravity the beasts can withstand.<br><br>A surnoch reproduces once every decade or so, in a process where a smaller creature slowly grows from the surnoch’s hide over the course of a month. This parthenogenesis is often preceded by a period of gorging by the surnoch, which is difficult to differentiate from the creature’s normal voracious feeding behavior. A surnoch feasting in this manner tends to consume minerals with natural radiation (such as uranium), though rocky areas that have been bombarded with nuclear weapons also tend to draw a surnoch ready to reproduce. Once the creature’s bud fully sprouts, it detaches with a burst of acid and the newly formed surnoch is ready to begin feeding. Luckily for the galaxy, at least a third of surnoch parents immediately consume their offspring immediately following this “birth” for reasons that continue to baffle biologists to this day.<br><br>While most surnochs are solitary creatures, two will occasionally travel and feed together, often working their way through parallel tunnels to consume different minerals. While to outsiders it might seem like the two surnochs are deliberately working in concert to cause the most destruction, the truth is far less sinister. The two creatures have been brought together by unknown electromagnetic symbols echoing off their thick hides and attuning their appetites to crave distinct fare. And just as quickly as the pair came together, some mysterious trigger can set them against one another in a tumbling mass of spines and acid that is usually even more devastating than the two surnochs feeding peacefully. A handful of survivors from a recent surnoch attack on a Glimmerglass Inc. production facility in the Diaspora claim that their factory was targeted by a rival company that placed a losing bid for the rights to their asteroid several years before. While their allegations have been dismissed as paranoid ravings, independent investigators found strange computer chips in the brain of what they believe is the corpse of the attacking surnoch.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 class=\"title\">Acid Lancer</h1>\n<p>In addition to collecting the valuable composites the creature leaves behind, some entrepreneurs enter surnochs’ territory to hunt and kill them for their acid-producing glands and spines. These components can be made into heavy weapons known as acid lancers, which shoot jets of caustic fluid. A wielder of an acid lancer can squeeze the gland located near the trigger to give her next shot an extra boost of damaging acid. Acid lancers use a special synthetic acid called caustrol for ammunition, which has the same price and comes in the same size containers as petrol.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any underground or vacuum (Diaspora)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary or

These creatures resemble monstrous lizards with sharp-toothed maws, nonfunctional wings, and strong tentacles in place of legs, which they use to grab prey. They stand up to 10 feet tall and weigh up to 500 pounds.<br><br>Skreesires typically live solitary lives on rocky planetoids. The beasts are fiercely protective of their territories, even from other skreesires. They view any intrusion from a sentient creature as a threat, and thus they often use their infamous mental abilities to twist intruders’ minds and cause those creatures to flee. If that fails, they descend on the trespasser with teeth and tentacles.<br><br>Skreesires are hermaphroditic and can self-fertilize, though they usually do so only after particularly large feasts, when they have the energy required to do so. They tend to lay their clutches of eggs in the corpses of the creatures they have just fed upon, but they use soft sand or tangles of vines if needed.<br><br>The brutal and shrewd skreelings are the immature offspring of skreesires that have not yet developed the full mental abilities of their progenitors. Skreeling siblings hunt in packs, combining their nascent fighting abilities to take down foes, and they are much stronger when they work together. Skreeling hosts, as xenobiologists call these packs, often live in rocky nooks and crannies or caves where they can better protect themselves from threats until they reach adulthood. Although they lack telepathy and the physical characteristics that would allow them to speak, skreelings can emit shrill, distinctive battle cries, often to distract prey or frighten predators away from their lairs.<br><br>Skreelings almost always lair within 100 yards or so of a parent skreesire’s territory. Skreelings are omnivorous and even ingest ash, metal shavings, or wood when regular food is scarce. Once the vicious creatures reach adulthood, their expanded intellects combined with their burgeoning appetites for territory often see siblings turn on each other until the host eventually disperses and the individual skreelings search for new lairs.<br><br>Skreelings typically are about 3 feet tall, weigh about 30 pounds, and have a wingspan of about 3-1/2 feet. As the creatures grow larger and mature into full-grown skreesires, they outgrow their wings—losing their ability to fly—and their lower legs atrophy and drop off, their tails developing into multiple ambulatory tentacles. This is a very gradual process that begins the moment they are born.<br><br>Occasionally, a skreeling becomes stunted in its development, growing too large to fly but not yet having a skreesire’s psychic faculties. These mutants—known as “skreemules”—are often killed by their siblings, but they sometimes escape to live solitary lives, crawling through the hills on their malformed tentacles and snapping at any potential prey.<br><br>Though uncommon, skreeling infestations near settlements are treated more like natural hazards to be avoided than pests to be eliminated. Some residents even derive a kind of pride from these annoyances, going so far as to name geological features of the area or local businesses after the creatures. These citizens make sure to warn travelers and newcomers about the skreeling lairs, as much to keep the flying aberrations safe as the people they caution. However, such settlements are quick to curtail the skreelings should they get violent, and they hold no such love for their far more dangerous adult forms.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any hills or

Standing almost 12 feet tall, a typical vracinea weighs 2,000 pounds, though one currently digesting a victim might be heavier.<br><br>Usually, a vracinea forsakes its mobility to lie in wait for its next meal, covering its lower half with nearby vines and branches and leaving only its blossom lures visible. If possible, it situates itself in a clearing or at the top of a rise to maximize its hunting range. Once its mesmerized prey has gotten close to it, the vracinea allows its flowers’ paralyzing odor to wash over its victim before the plant creature bursts forth from its camouflage and attacks. If an injured prey manages to shake off the scent’s effects and attempts to escape, the vracinea will pursue as best it can for a short time before giving up and beginning its hunting cycle over again, often selecting a new location in the process.<br><br>Xenobotanists aren’t certain of the mechanisms behind a vracinea’s blossom lures, as only a few scientists who set out to study these plant creatures have returned with evidence. Some believe the flowers vibrate at an almost subatomic level, stimulating a target’s subconscious desires, while others think that the vracinea transmits psychic impulses to its prey through the flowers. Either way, affected creatures can’t help but move toward the vracinea until they get caught within the plant’s paralyzing scent aura, after which they are quickly devoured.<br><br>Vracineas are solitary and territorial creatures. When two come into contact, they often charge at one another, quickly becoming locked in a struggle of gnashing teeth until one falls dead or retreats to nurse its wounds. The stakes of such skirmishes can be especially high, given that nearby prey are often unable to resist the draw of both creatures and end up standing by, paralyzed. The winning vracinea claims any such prizes and claims the nearby territory. It then picks a new hiding spot and patiently waits for other victims to appear. Rarely, a starving vracinea-easily recognizable by the deep purple coloration of its blossom lures-will pursue, kill, and feast on the loser of a contest of dominance, though this is the only time a vracinea partakes in cannibalism. In fact, a vracinea usually refuses to eat other plant creatures; xenobotanists believe those that do are in fact attempting to reach unabsorbed meat in the other creature’s system.<br><br>On Castrovel, vracineas flourish on the continent of Ukulam, where they can stake expansive hunting grounds and avoid other voracious members of their species. All is not completely peaceful, however, as many vracineas compete for food with the jungle’s other carnivorous creatures, such as tentacled ksariks and serpentine mountain eels. Over many generations, ksariks have learned to detect the scent of vracineas from greater and greater distances, along with the knowledge that they have little to gain from ingesting a vracinea’s genetic information. In addition, the two plant creatures tend to be evenly matched, making any confrontation between the two dangerous for both. As a result, they generally only come into direct conflict in times of desperation, or occasionally when a ksarik is tracking victims infected by its carrion spores. Mountain eels, on the other hand, are often more powerful than vracineas, though the two only fight for resources if a vracinea attempts to claim part of a mountainside frequented by a bed of mountain eels for its hunting ground. Usually outnumbered, a vracinea is quickly dispatched by mountain eels, but occasionally one of the plant creatures discovers a nest of newly born elvers left behind by its parents and enjoys a grand feast.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>temperate and warm forests (Castrovel)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Plant","environment":"","cr":4,"xp":{"value":1200},"source":"AA 3 (p 130)","aura":"Paralyzing Scent - 15 Ft., Fortitude DC 13","raceAndGrafts":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":10,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":10,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":15,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":10,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"large","senses":"low-light vision","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":"Plant Immunities"},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":"Plant Immunities"},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{"sfrpg":{"conditions":[]}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Vracinea","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"9FE4xzm9lcXEzdjC","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"IZ9d4jYdzXaIp61z","flags":{},"name":"Paralyzing Scent (Ex)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"A vracinea constantly exudes a sweet odor to a radius of 15 feet.

Although shantaks appear ungainly on land when perched on their two legs, their vast, bat-like wings enable the creatures to soar gracefully through vacuum as easily as they fly in atmospheres. Slimy scales cover a shantak’s body, and its vaguely horselike head features a wide maw filled with dagger-like teeth. A shantak is about 30 feet long from nose to tail and weighs approximately 6,000 pounds. Planetside, shantaks inhabit remote and foreboding mountain peaks, but their ability to survive in and fly through vacuum means they can also be found in the void of space.<br><br>Despite their bestial appearances, shantaks are intelligent, and speak in shrill voices that sound like glass grinding against stone. They are willful creatures and cannot simply be trained as mounts. A would-be shantak rider must first seek out a shantak, braving its lair or hunting grounds, and then use diplomacy or magic to secure a shantak’s cooperation as a mount, often with a liberal dose of flattery. Even then, shantaks have a tendency to deliberately strand riders in dangerous areas, or worse, revoke their shared defenses while in the depths of space so their riders asphyxiate and swiftly perish. The flesh of such unfortunate riders is particularly delightful to a shantak, especially if it is able to feed where the rider’s one-time allies and friends can watch.<br><br>Many shantaks have a strange and irrational fear of certain humanoid winged creatures, such as faceless nightgaunts said to dwell in certain dreams, or specific types of winged humanoids more common in civilized regions. While these irrational fears are usually not so overwhelming as to have physical or mental effects on a shantak, shantaks do take pains to avoid confrontations with these other types of creatures if at all possible.<br><br>Shantaks’ ability to travel the gulf of space ensures that these scaly creatures can be found on numerous worlds and their satellites. Yet despite this ability, shantaks are generally quite reluctant to seek out new worlds on their own unless faced with no other option, for a shantak knows well that an attempt to fly to an unknown world could easily result in being lost forever in the depths of space. Before the widespread use of Drift technology, some species employed shantaks as a rare and dangerous method of traveling among the stars, and there may well be as-yet-undiscovered civilizations in the Vast that continue to do so—perhaps because their technological advancement has not reached a level where they can use Drift travel.<br><br>Curiously, even those who have never encountered a shantak in real life often know of these creatures, for shantaks dwell in the shared dreams of slumbering minds as surely as in the depths of space. Some scientists and philosophers have gone so as far as to suggest that shantaks first hailed from a mysterious shared demiplane within the Dimension of Dreams called the Dreamlands. These scholars further posit that eerie and dangerous rituals have enabled the creatures to transform themselves from figments imagined by sleeping minds into creatures that exist in the waking world on countless planets.<br><br>Although shantaks do not enjoy the presence of active starships—almost as if the energies exuded by an active power core cause them some sort of intense discomfort— shantaks are quite fond of derelict ships. Large numbers of shantaks have been reported to roost in the nooks and crannies of a drifting hulk’s hull, and exploration of the interior of these abandoned ships often reveals truly disturbing “caches” of food—the partially eaten remains of entire crews. Shantaks that roost in derelict starships take full advantage of their adoptive homes, ensuring their nests are well hidden from observation. These shantaks can be quite cunning in dressing the hulk in what appears to be valuable scrap, and some have even learned to tamper with shipboard alarm systems to send out false distress signals. The most cunning and dangerous of these drifting traps arise when the shantaks forge an alliance with another creature, often an undead created when a starship is destroyed. A shantak flock can wing off to distant worlds to retrieve rare necessities for their allies, returning via spaceflight to keep the denizen of a stranded derelict well supplied in luxuries that, without their own ship to command, they would otherwise be forced to forgo.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shantak Whistles</h2>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTalentsAll_ctl00_LabelName\">While the advent of Drift technology has made interstellar travel accessible to the masses, not everyone is comfortable with using starships to travel. Some have philosophical reasons for avoiding the Drift, while others take offense at the notion of answering to the whim of a starship captain. Many have goals among the stars that they prefer not to share with others. Whatever the reason, the opportunity to travel atop a shantak’s slippery back remains the preferred (and perhaps only viable) option for some. A shantak whistle is a sought-after tool for those who wish to find a shantak mount.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>cold mountains or

Constantly driven to root out and consume intelligent plant creatures, zernivians stalk their prey by taking over the bodies of harmless animals as a means of camouflage. Once a zernivian locates a plant creature, it quickly emerges from the host animal and attacks, using a combination of tongue lashings and a natural herbicide to take down its victim. Xenobiologists are unsure where the solitary zernivians originate from or even how they reproduce.<br/><br/>Although zernivians have become a problem on Ghorus Prime, the native ghorans are far from the zernivian’s favorite food. That “honor” goes to the fungal dycepskians, who do whatever they can to terminate these predators on sight, as zernivians have the uncanny ability to sniff out dycepskians occupying even the most unlikely of host bodies.<br/><br/>Site Owner: Blake DavisEmail Spam Checker: MX Guarddog</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section

However, reports of strange undead creatures appearing on starships and space stations near these deadly cosmic phenomena have led kasatha mystics aboard the Idari to conjecture that the terrible agony undergone by those consumed by a black hole sometimes allows their spirits to escape the phenomenon and continue on to wreak havoc among the living. The kasathas call such entities vorthuuls, though they are sometimes referred to as singularity wraiths by others. A vorthuul is a strange apparition that appears to be composed of two intertwined forms: one a squat, obsidian skeleton that emanates calm, the other the phantom visage of a creature eternally screaming in unbearable pain as it is stretched to impossible lengths. Neither of these forms ever separates from the other, though one spirit always seems to have dominance at any given moment, pulling along the other with its whims.<br/><br/>Kasatha sages suggest that these two entangled spirits were once a single living creature that suffered the extreme misfortune of being pulled inexorably into the mouth of a black hole. In this moment, where time and reality get twisted, the black hole creates two versions of the same creature: one that is tortuously extended vertically while being compressed horizontally, and the other that is crushed into infinite density as it is drawn into the singularity. Both versions of the original creature are horribly killed, of course, and their spirits are linked to one another through quantum entanglement.<br/><br/>While no one knows precisely how these two versions of the same creature’s spirit combine to form an undead vorthuul, those who travel the void know the true dangers these creatures present. Seemingly able to harness the gravitational forces of a black hole, a vorthuul is a horrifying sight for a party of adventurers hoping to loot an abandoned starship or mine precious metals from the surface of an asteroid.<br/><br/>A vorthuul can appear on a starship, research station, or other celestial object when it passes close to a black hole (though not close enough to be caught by the singularity’s gravitational pull), seemingly manifesting as an avatar of the black hole itself. A singularity that has swallowed countless souls might be “home” to a large group of vorthuuls, making the region of space near that black hole particularly dangerous to living creatures. Such collections of vorthuuls often go unreported if no one makes it out of the area alive, leading to rumors of “haunted” stretches of space.<br/><br/>Solarians-especially those of the kasatha species-are especially aware of and concerned with the threat vorthuuls pose. Some solarians believe that many vorthuuls were once members of the same tradition who became disproportionately attuned with graviton forces. Their connection with the cosmic forces of gravity and light became imbalanced, contributing to their rebirth as vorthuuls, and they now seek out living solarians to completely destroy them.<br/><br/>Other groups, such as the Cult of the Devourer, respect the vorthuuls’ uncanny power, viewing them as avatars of their god of infinite destruction, and may even attempt to capture a vorthuul in an attempt to unleash its wrath upon their foes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section

These icy, venomous vespids lay their eggs in living creatures.</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Eox)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or colony (3-6)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Vermin (space)","environment":"","cr":3,"xp":{"value":800},"source":"AA 2 (p 132)","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":8,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"large","senses":"darkvision 60 ft.","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["acid"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{"sfrpg":{"conditions":[]}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Necropede","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"xm7zc9B3MvGMM9V5","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"9sAlz2Gy7izLFoDw","flags":{},"name":"Void Adaptation","type":"feat","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>(EX OR SU)</p>\n<p>Numerous creatures are inured to the void of outer space.

The ascension of the artificially intelligent god Triune, who now holds technology and artificial life as its domains, has not eased such fears. Despite Triune’s claim of neutrality, the ubiquity of technology throughout the Pact Worlds and beyond has spurred many divine powers to keep careful watch over both the ways in which current technology is employed as well as rapid technological progress that could threaten all life.<br/><br/>As angels have always been the messengers and enactors of the gods’ will, a particular order of angelic beings, known as barachiuses, oversees technological advances and ensures these creations don’t fall into the wrong hands or become twisted to serve evil gods and their minions. Outfitted with divinely blessed armor, weapons, and abilities, barachius angels are tasked with monitoring the planes both to protect mortal existence from technology gone awry and to quash technologically advanced cultures that present an explicit threat to all good creatures and causes. While all angels might be expected to protect the innocent from harm, barachiuses specialize in defending against subtle technological threats that might go unnoticed by the rank-and-file troops of the celestial legions. When a rapidly developing AI suddenly veers into true evil, when a new invention threatens to destroy countless innocents, when Hell’s hacker devils feed insidious viruses into mortal mainframes-these are when barachiuses truly shine.<br/><br/>A barachius is an imposing figure, standing in what appears to be sleek, glowing armor and wielding a sword that pulses with the light of the stars or a glowing laser rifle. Its wings appear to be made of pure electricity, though a closer look reveals patterns within the feathery arcs that mimic digital arrays and computer wiring. Its face is often hidden behind an elaborate helm, and its voice-when it deigns to speak-is clipped and rapid-fire.<br/><br/>Yet a barachius’s true strength resides not within its presence or arms but in its near-prescient ability to understand the nature of any technological object or being that it encounters. Exactly how and why the angels deem some technology not just dangerous but immoral is a great mystery, as it’s not based solely on sheer destructive capacity. For instance, barachiuses have been known to hunt down and destroy individual robots with extreme determination while leaving similar models-and silos of nuclear missiles-entirely untouched.<br/><br/>A barachius might serve its purpose in a wide variety of ways. It could secretly patrol a settlement that is already rife with technology, constantly on the search for malicious computer code, machines run amok, or creatures bent on using technology for nefarious ends. Alternatively, one could be found searching for scientists and laboratories where cutting-edge research is being conducted. Even researchers with the best of intentions may come under the scrutiny of a barachius that deems the ongoing work or latest invention too threatening to the society’s ongoing moral health. Barachiuses also keep watch over some planets and species that lack advanced technology to ensure that they’re not enslaved or annihilated by races with greater resources-though again, why they perform this action for some races and not others is a mystery deeply vexing to scholars and mystics. Many believe their choices are based on an ability to see lines of probability stretching into the future and the angels’ need to make minor course corrections now and then to avoid catastrophe. Rarely, a barachius might take a more redemptive approach. Rather than destroying evil-aligned devices and technological life-forms, it might seek to turn a target to the path of good. Barachiuses minister to androids and robots in particular, hoping that merciful actions might inspire the artificial creatures to similar acts.<br/><br/>Barachius Helm<br/><br/>What looks like a magnificent helmet on a barachius is actually an extension of its being, and thus it can never be taken from it by force. On occasion, however, a barachius particularly impressed by a mortal might offer that champion a magical copy of its own helm that’s imbued with a sliver of its essence and grants the wearer some of its own power.<br/><br/>Extra Content<br/><br/>The following extra content was found for this creature:<br/><br/>- Angel (Creature Subtype) Graft Template<br/><br/>- Angel (Summoning) Graft

Individually, these creatures have significant physical variety, resembling wasps, mantises, and moths, among others. Each inch‑long spathinae is much like the insect it resembles, but thousands organize themselves to form a biological and neural network. The result is a colony that operates much like a single sapient creature.<br><br>Such a colony is like a swarm and refers to themselves in the plural, but their consciousness is specific, with one personality and set of memories. The colony can alter their shape. Most take humanoid form, speaking with a buzzing, layered voice from a featureless “head.” Spathinae colonies prefer armor adjusted so each constituent can wear one component, allowing the colony to behave like a swarm.<br><br>Most colonies realize creatures made up of a single contiguous mass can have difficulty thinking of a distributed sapience as a group with a common purpose, rather than a single creature able to act like a swarm. Most spathinae use the colony’s name without pointing out that each constituent has its own name.<br><br>Damage can disrupt a spathinae colony’s network, or even cause the colony to “die,” their connection failing and sapience fading away. Hundreds of constituents might survive, but the colony dissipates, barring magic that returns life to and reunifies the disintegrated consciousness. Remnants of “dead” colonies might join other constituents to form a new colony, but any connection to the original is ephemeral.<br><br>Spathinae do not grieve such losses. Many revere Oras and see life as a constant process of exploration and change. Constituents make sacrifices so the colony can thrive. Colonies take risks, face challenges, adapt, and dissolve to advance their species. A given colony can endure for more than a century, but colonies also disperse and re-form, surrendering individuality for greater good.<br><br>Even the spathinae do not know where they originated—any records of this place were lost to the Gap. They have no clear indication if any planet on which they now reside was their home world. Most spathinae colonies pay little heed to their lack of history, however, as evolution continues without regard for the past. Some feel, though, that purposeful advancement requires them to seek their origin and learn from that place.<br><br>Most societies treat spathinae colonies as individuals, with the rights and obligations thereof. However, a few peoples, such as the Azlanti, see spathinae colonies as no more than a collection of bugs, and in such cases, the colonies have no rights at all.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or team (3-6)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Monstrous Humanoid","environment":"","cr":11,"xp":{"value":12800},"source":"AA3 pg. 100","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":26,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":26,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":21,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":21,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":21,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":26,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"medium","senses":"blindsense (vibration) 30 ft., darkvision 60 ft.","languages":{"value":["brethedan","castrovelian","common","nchaki","shirren","vesk"],"custom":"Spathinae"},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Spathinae Explorer","displayName":40,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"2wzUe5XCXwX8mYzi","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"flags":{},"name":"Evasion (Ex)","type":"feat","img":"systems/sfrpg/icons/classes/evasion.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>&gt;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-pack=\"sfrpg.classes\" data-id=\"uf8ADOAeBrtUkPVl\" draggable=\"true\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Operative</a></p>\n        <p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListClasses_ctl00_LabelName\">If you succeed at a Reflex save against an effect that normally has a partial effect on a successful save, you instead suffer no effect.

They were formed by mystical vibrations between the Elemental and Ethereal Planes, coalescing pure ethereal energy into the first of these sentient beings. These tiny creatures gathered into nomadic groups that wandered the Elemental Planes. They approached their lives with joy and wonder, marveling at the spectacular beauty and vast bounty of new experiences that their home had to offer. They were sensitive to the subtle interactions and resonances between sources of elemental energy and perceived these resonances as a musical expression of the nature of reality. The wysps most skilled at reading and manipulating this music, called wysp conductors, rapidly rose to positions of leadership within their communities. These conductors largely operated independently from one another but occasionally collaborated on projects of a particularly grand scale. Perhaps the greatest of all of these endeavors was what wysps refer to as the “song of creation”—a performance in which a large group of wysps harmonizes with an Elemental Plane to give birth to new members of their kind.<br>As their numbers grew, the largely peaceful and curious wysps drew the attention of the elemental lords, demigods who inhabit the Elemental Planes. The elemental lords saw great value in the wysps’ understanding of elemental resonances, and sought to turn it toward their own ends. To make the wysps into better minions, the elemental lords revised their song of creation, producing new generations of wysps with innate tendencies toward service and self-sacrifice. Over time, these generations lost some of their connection to the music of the universe. These new wysps became specialized, turning into air, earth, fire, and water wysps as they were each attuned to a single Elemental Plane. Despite all these changes, these modified wysps retained the cheerful and curious disposition of their ancestors.<br>While most wysps lead lives dedicated to the service of other elemental beings, a few small groups of wysps have escaped the influence of the elemental lords and returned to lifestyles more akin to their ancestors. Led by wysp conductors who have regained their natural affinity for the music of creation, these bands of wysps rarely stay in one place for long. Free symphonies of wysps tend to be cautious around anyone they suspect may want to take away their independence, responding to potential dangers by fleeing across the planes rather than engaging in confrontation.</span></p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Elemental Planes)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary or symphony (one plus 5-20 wysps)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"outsider (elemental, extraplanar)","environment":"","cr":8,"xp":{"value":4800},"source":"AP #15 (p 60)","aura":"Resonance - 30 Ft.","raceAndGrafts":"Wysp envoy"},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":21,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":16,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":16,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":21,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":21,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":16,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"tiny","senses":"darkvision 60 ft.","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":"Elemental Immunities"},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":"Elemental Immunities"},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{"sfrpg":{"conditions":[]}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Wysp Conductor","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"aLU0p40Sq0AL3tIU","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"YXE0VJPHS4y8q7Be","flags":{},"name":"Resonance (Ex)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"The elemental energy of a wysp resonates with the bodies of creatures that share its elemental subtype.

Their eyes are pure-black orbs, protruding from their heads in half domes like the eyes of a mouse, and they can change the pigment of their skin at will to have complex patterns. Nearly all verthani learn to control these color changes by the time they reach puberty, but babies and children display bright, expressive patterns and colors that reflect their current mood. Some adults also refuse to control them, seeing in their random patterns hints of prophecy.<br><br>Long ago, verthani society was split into three castes: the Augmented, the Pure Ones, and the God-Vessels. A verthani’s caste is chosen during adolescence. Though few verthani today bind themselves strictly by the system’s rules, the traditions still carry a measure of cultural pride, and some verthani proudly wear the labels.<br><br>The Augmented are verthani who modify their bodies with technology, usually cybernetic augmentations. This caste was particularly popular with those who piloted early aetherships (the elegant vessels verthani first sailed through the stars), and Augmented verthani pilots are still renowned as some of the most skilled in the Pact Worlds.<br><br>In contrast, Pure Ones traditionally eschewed all technological augmentation and were responsible for supporting other castes, farming, and governing. While many modern Pure Ones have accepted at least some modest cybernetic or biotech improvements to their bodies, these verthani remain proud of their traditional caretaker roles.<br><br>God-Vessels serve faithfully as living avatars of their deities, displaying this status by branding holy symbols called devotionals into their chests using either acid or flame. God-Vessels never cover up these distinctive marks, despite the fact that the scar tissue around them never fully heals and can no longer change color.<br><br>Verthani culture is a model of independent, democratic cooperation. Forced to live on a cramped sliver of their planet, surrounded by nearly inhospitable lands on either side, verthani learned how to work together without violence or subjugation, and they choose to harness technology to increase resources rather than battle one another over scraps. Verces’s Ring of Nations remains a shining example of a one-world government in which citizens remain protected yet free to go their own way, and in many ways the Pact Worlds system itself was directly inspired by this aspect of verthani culture.</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Verces)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or cabal (3-5)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Offense</h2>\n<h3>Connection</h3>\n<p>Akashic</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Humanoid (verthani)","environment":"","cr":9,"xp":{"value":6400},"source":"AA 1 (p 119)","subtype":"Verthani","raceAndGrafts":"Verthani mystic","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":17,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":17,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":17,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":22,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":22,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":17,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":17,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"medium","senses":"low-light vision","languages":{"value":["abyssal","celestial","common","vercite"],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":"0","max":"0"},"spell2":{"value":"5","max":"6"},"spell3":{"value":"3","max":"3"},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{"sfrpg":{"conditions":[]}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Verthani Pure One","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"pasT6e0YLhLNoPEb","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"xwm8d238lEg1Qd7G","flags":{},"name":"Staff, carbon","type":"weapon","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Staves are long and flexible, weighted on the end to provide extra striking power.

Each variety of aeon holds sway over an aspect of the natural order and seeks to maintain equilibrium, indifferent to any concerns of ethics or morality. Tekhoinos aeons concern themselves with the balance between social development and technological advancement. Populations whose scientific advancements have outstripped their social development are likely to draw a tekhoinos’s attention, as are those who forcefully suppress technological development in favor of spiritual concerns.<br/><br/>Tekhoinos often become involved when a society is uplifted or held back by outside forces, but they also step in when a society manages to unbalance itself. Exactly what constitutes a society out of balance is determined by an intricate code unfathomable to any but the aeons. When an imbalance is suspected, a single tekhoinos visits the society, gathers intelligence with its innate powers, and then confers with a larger collective of tekhoinos and other aeons via its envisaging ability. Once a consensus is reached, the tekhoinos can begin its intervention, wait for reinforcements, or move on to seek out more imbalanced civilizations.<br/><br/>Technological excess that would draw a tekhoinos’s attention might include any less-advanced species that stumbles across advanced technology or species that invent technologies that their societies lack the cultural maturity to handle. On the other end of the spectrum, societies that eschew technology to the extent that harm is done to their societal development might attract tekhoinos, which then seek to inspire new inventions or disrupt the social constructs that keep technological innovation at bay. Tekhoinos prefer covert actions such as manipulation and sabotage to direct confrontation, but this preference is not out of a desire to protect the recipients of their intervention-the aeons have merely found that subtlety makes for more lasting change. This clandestine approach also does not mean the aeons’ actions are benign. A collective might rectify an imbalance through covert manipulation of key individuals or targeted assassinations, or they might take more drastic measures, such as detonating a starship’s reactor or instigating a war, all based on cold calculations regarding which actions give the highest probability of long-term success.<br/><br/>Tekhoinos take great pains to hide their presence, lest notice of their tampering lead to further imbalance. They spend most of their time invisible, and they move carefully and deliberately to further evade detection. They prefer to incapacitate those who discover them, but they don’t hesitate to dispose of creatures that prove a threat to their aims.<br/><br/>Tekhoinos normally intervene in the affairs of single planets, isolated communities, or remote outposts since sprawling planetary and interplanetary populations more readily resist change and are more likely to uncover tekhoinos’s manipulations. However, when major populations swing so far out of balance that they can’t be ignored, they warrant intervention by multiple tekhoinos collectives. Such grand interventions can require generations of covert observation and manipulation before massive, coordinated action, all overseen by elder aeons of significantly greater capabilities.<br/><br/>Such major actions might be subtle. However, if the threat of the imbalance is widespread but its source centralized, or if swift action is required, the intervention could resemble an invasion. The tekhoinos collectives assigned to the intervention might take direct control of problematic sites or objects. Forced into such action, the aeons then directly confront any defenders of those problem areas.<br/><br/>A tekhoinos has no eyes, instead perceiving with its entire body. Three tentacle-like limbs revolve around a tekhoinos’s nebulous core, and the substance of each limb shifts constantly. Across the aeon’s body, patterns of crystalline circuitry and iridescent vapor form, propagate, and give way, the same structure never repeating. The typical tekhoinos measures 4 feet across but weighs only a few pounds.<br/><br/>Like all their kin, tekhoinos communicate using mental imagery rather than words. Among their own kind, they can share the full range of experience and emotion via these images, but communication with non-aeons is far more limited. However, as caretakers of civilization, tekhoinos have better insight into the minds of other creatures than typical aeons have. They can make full use of their telepathic images to communicate with other creatures even when such interactions would normally require a shared language.<br/><br/>Adaptive Defense Module Armor Upgrades<br/><br/>Despite their secrecy, tekhoinos have been identified as the corrective force behind more than one newly stabilized society, and they have even been celebrated for their role. One civilization on a lonely planet in Near Space had great mastery over magic and technology, but its people had long turned a blind eye to the great suffering they caused one another. After a tekhoinos intervened and ushered in an era of peace and prosperity, these people designed an armor upgrade meant to honor their benefactor.<br/><br/>Extra Content<br/><br/>The following extra content was found for this creature:<br/><br/>- Aeon (Summoning) Graft Template<br/><br/>- Aeon (Creature Subtype) Graft Template</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Outer Planes)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or collective (3-10)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","public":""},"type":"Outsider (aeon, extraplanar)","environment":"","cr":10,"xp":{"value":9600},"source":"AA2 (pg. 6)","subtype":"Aeon, Extraplanar","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":19,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":19,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":19,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":19,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":24,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":19,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":19,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":24,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"medium","senses":"darkvision 60 ft.","languages":{"value":[],"custom":"Envisaging"},"di":{"value":["cold"],"custom":"Critical Hits, Poison"},"dr":{"value":[{"electricity":"10"},{"fire":"10"}],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":"Critical Hits, Poison"},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":21},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":"0","max":"0"},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":"0","max":"0"},"spell4":{"value":"0","max":"0"},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":"0","max":"0"}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Tekhoinos","displayName":40,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":60,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"zkcDjtUjpfqq0ykC","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"flags":{},"name":"Adaptive Defense (Ex)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"When a tekhoinos takes acid, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, it gains resistance 10 to that damage type.

Life is barely sustainable on Lajok, and as its sun grows dimmer, it might be able to sustain an ecosphere for only a few more centuries. Some vlakas respond to this knowledge by building strong communities that can last as long as possible on their home world, but others travel among the stars seeking a longer-term solution.<br><br>Vlaka fur is usually white with large patches of pale blue, gray, or black, and it provides them protection against all but the most bitter cold. Around twothirds of vlakas are born blind or deaf. Although they have long had access to magic and technology that can mitigate or remove such conditions, not all vlakas choose to do so, valuing the cultural touchstones such as language and perspective variances that are associated with differing ways of sensing the world. A typical vlaka stands 5-1/2 to 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs between 175 and 250 lbs.<br><br>Vlakas can appear unnervingly serious, but they’re acutely attuned to the emotional state of others, and they offer friendly encouragement when they sense it might be helpful. Vlakas emphasize on the well-being of the group over the individual, a practice that evolved from survival strategies required to thrive in the tundra of Lajok. While not wholly self-sacrificing, vlakas go to great lengths to assist, protect, and encourage their friends, colleagues, and kin. Vlakas frown upon self-aggrandizing leadership, and they respect those who display wisdom, listen the most, and speak the least.<br><br>Most vlaka groups are led by councils whose members rotate between roles and dutifully carry out the will of their constituents rather than seeking political power for themselves. Vlakas who travel with other races often find themselves thrust into leadership positions thanks to their penchant for working for the benefit of and listening to their allies. Most vlakas accept such responsibilities but deflect any unwarranted respect afforded them solely due to their title.<br><br>A few vlakas who visited the Pact Worlds before the Absalom Pact was signed served as a bridge between Eox and other worlds. Vlakas have since become famous as dependable go-betweens for groups seeking genuine accord. A vlaka might even work with clients who have been bad actors in the past, hoping to find a situation beneficial to all sides and to see ethical improvement in future behavior.<br><br>Many sapient creatures find themselves drawn to the camaraderie vlakas offer, but others try to take advantage of their openness. Vlakas who grow weary of the strife among other races might withdraw to focus on working with animals or machines. However, most vlakas seek well-intentioned groups of like-minded starfarers to do some good in a galaxy that can be callous and brutal.</span></p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Lajok)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or pack (3-5)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"humanoid (vlaka)","environment":"","cr":2,"xp":{"value":600},"source":"AA 2 (p 134)","raceAndGrafts":"Vlake mechanic","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":12,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":12,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":7,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":12,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":7,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":7,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"medium","senses":"blindsight (scent) 30 ft., deafened, low-light vision","languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":"Vlakan"},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[{"cold":"5"}],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{"sfrpg":{"conditions":[]}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Vlaka Tracker","displayName":0,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"KSzv2jBJx7Ml49rv","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"FJYkfG23DEh5W0R8","flags":{},"name":"Baton, tactical","type":"weapon","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A baton is a thin, solid metal shaft, usually with a textured rubber grip.

They have a unique outlook: individualistic without being anarchic, and somehow unable (or perhaps unwilling) to grasp the concept of permanent governance. They understand and enjoy teamwork, and naturally follow a qualified leader to undertake large projects such as the building of domiciles, but once that task has been completed, the leader doesn’t continue to hold sway over the others. Coupled with their unusual life cycle, it would seem as if skittermanders would be very difficult to rule. But such is not exactly the case.<br><br>When vesk warships appeared in the sky, skittermanders across Vesk-3 were more than happy to get out of the invaders’ way—not out of fear, but more because of their innate desire to help. Skittermanders instinctively recognized the Veskarium’s superior strength and felt they could best aid the empire by simply not being in the same location as its soldiers. In this way, skittermanders believed the vesk could quickly achieve their goals and move on. They didn’t understand the vesk’s aim was to subdue their world. Since vesk’s code of honor forbade them from shooting the cheerfully acquiescent skittermanders in the back, the invaders were confused and infuriated by the situation.<br><br>Eventually, in a meeting that the empire notes as the official date that Vesk-3 was conquered, a vesk general plainly told a group of skittermanders that the Veskarium ruled their planet. The skittermanders nodded and got back to their lives. Since then, the empire has ruled Vesk-3, though it hasn’t truly been in control of it. Skittermanders cheerfully accept jobs given to them by vesk, but never truly acknowledge the vesk as being in charge. Some outside the Veskarium believe skittermanders are being deliberately obtuse, reaping all the technological and social benefits the empire offers while still partially maintaining their freedom as a society, but no skittermander has ever confirmed this theory.<br><br>Today, skittermanders can be found throughout the Veskarium, often serving in clerical positions that allow them to aid as many people as possible. They have fully embraced technology and enjoy the many sights the galaxy has to offer, traveling to the Pact Worlds and beyond. Those who employ skittermanders quickly learn to give them missions that have open-ended parameters, as a skittermander who feels she has completed a task won’t necessarily report back to a superior for further instructions if she finds someone else who needs her help first. Outsiders often find them cheerfully manic, noting a goblin-like flair for the ridiculous but none of that race’s innate malice.<br><br>Though skittermanders are mammals, they begin life in something akin to a larval stage. A skittermander whelp looks like a miniature version of an adult, but with more prominent ears and a tiny, secondary mouth on its abdomen. Once born, whelps are left to fend for themselves. They are truly omnivorous, capable of digesting fruits, leaves, raw meat, and seeds. Additionally, a whelp’s secondary mouth allows it to attach itself to large prey and feed at its leisure. Thanks to a numbing mucus secreted by this mouth, less intelligent animals rarely even notice the whelp’s samplings. A swarm of skittermander whelps has been known to bring down a trundling bovine monoux in a matter of minutes.<br><br>After 6 years, whelps mature into adult skittermanders, begin to walk upright, and lose their secondary mouths, but they maintain their taste for anything remotely edible. Skittermanders living in tropical climes have short, soft fur, while their arctic cousins grow tough, shaggy hair. Their coloration varies even more, with tones of blue, green, and violet being the most common, but with no obvious correlation to their surroundings.<br><br>The average adult skittermander is 3 feet

A planetwide disaster millions of years ago split the common ancestor of both species into two populations. One population remained on the planet’s devastated surface and evolved into the skittermanders. The other population retreated into the planet’s extensive cave system, becoming larger, faster, and increasingly vicious as they competed for dwindling food supplies. Eventually, the stridermanders reemerged on the surface and the two populations met once again—and the skittermanders became prey.<br><br>Called strovion by the vesk, which roughly translates as “skittering wolves,” stridermanders are brawny and threatening. Like most natives of Vesk-3, they have eight limbs, four of which are long and graceful, capable of running at high speeds and climbing through the rocky caverns where the creatures make their nests. The four shorter arms are more muscular and used for restraining prey, mating, and manipulating their environment. Their most identifiable feature is a feeding tendril that emerges from their abdomen— similar to that of a skittermander whelp—which is long enough and strong enough to drag a grown human through the darkness or lift a vesk soldier into the air.<br><br>Stridermanders feed by restraining their victims and puncturing their flesh, draining their fluids first so the rest of the body can be eaten more slowly over time. They prefer preying on skittermanders but will attack and devour anything their own size or smaller, as the vesk have discovered.<br><br>While simpleminded and animalistic, stridermanders are clever predators and construct simple obsidian tools. They have no language but hunt using coordinated pack tactics. Even more terrifying, skittermander legends speak of stridermander tyrants—larger, more vicious mutants with uncanny abilities to cloud people’s minds and fool the senses.<br><br>Today, stridermanders remain a danger in Vesk-3’s deep forests and caverns, though the Veskarium has heavily curtailed their numbers. Their whelps are small, rodent-like, and solitary, making them difficult to exterminate and allowing them to easily stow away on starships. Stridermanders have consequently migrated to several other worlds, where they reproduce quickly and fill apex predator roles in wilderness and ruins environments. Vesk see the species as dangerous predators worthy of hunting, and the Veskarium has exported stridermanders off-world for use as guard beasts, and for a variety of dangerous sporting events.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ecology</h2>\n<h3>Environment</h3>\n<p>any (Vesk-3)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Organization</h3>\n<p>solitary, pair, or route (3-10)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","public":""},"type":"Monstrous Humanoid","environment":"","cr":3,"xp":{"value":800},"source":"AA3 pg. 104","subtype":"Skittermander","raceAndGrafts":"","aura":""},"skills":{"acr":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ath":{"ability":"str","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":8,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"blu":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"com":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"cul":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dip":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"dis":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"eng":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"int":{"ability":"cha","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"lsc":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"med":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"mys":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"per":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":8,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"phs":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pil":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"pro":{"ability":"int","ranks":0,"value":3,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false,"subname":""},"sen":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false},"sle":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":0,"enabled":false,"isTrainedOnly":true,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"ste":{"ability":"dex","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":13,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":true},"sur":{"ability":"wis","ranks":0,"value":0,"misc":0,"mod":8,"enabled":true,"isTrainedOnly":false,"hasArmorCheckPenalty":false}},"traits":{"size":"medium","senses":"darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":"Light Blindness"},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"damageReduction":{"value":0,"negatedBy":""},"sr":0},"currency":{"credit":0,"upb":0},"spells":{"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0}},"modifiers":[],"conditions":{},"counterClasses":{"values":{}}},"flags":{},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Stridermander","displayName":40,"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"MahXL40r5qekogMI","actorLink":false,"actorData":{},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false,"lightColor":"","mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false},"items":[{"flags":{},"name":"Camouflage (Ex)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"A stridermander can alter the color and texture of its fur to blend into its environment.

A scyphozoan has a soft and translucent body, with several ambulatory tentacles as well as two prehensile tentacles. In water, a scyphozoan swims by expanding and contracting its bell, which propels the creature forward. The bell and tentacles are sensitive to vibrations in the air or water, allowing the scyphozoan to sense nearby creatures even if she can’t see them. A scyphozoan is approximately 7 feet tall and weighs up to 200 pounds.
