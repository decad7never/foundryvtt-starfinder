      "value": "<p>(SU)</p>\n<p>Some creatures can exhale a cone or line of energy or another magical effect. A breath weapon attack usually deals damage, and it is often energy-based. A breath weapon usually allows a target to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage, though some breath weapons require a successful Fortitude or Will save instead. A creature is immune to its own breath weapon and the breath weapons of others of its kind unless otherwise noted. Each breath weapon also indicates how often it can be used.</p>\n<p>Guidelines: 1d6 damage + 1d6 per CR, usable once every 1d4<span style=\"font-size: 1.125em;\">&nbsp;</span>rounds. A cone is usually 30 feet long, increasing by 10 feet for every size category above Medium or decreasing by 5 feet for every size category below Medium. A line is twice as long as a cone would be.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
