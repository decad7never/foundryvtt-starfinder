You aren&rsquo;t @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.RxvbSB9ZgSCBu2jw]{Helpless}, though you are treated as having a Dexterity modifier of &ndash;5. You can take purely mental actions but no physical actions. If you are flying in the air when you become paralyzed and your flight is dependent on physical means (such as wings), you fall. If you are swimming when you become paralyzed, you could drown (see Suffocation and Drowning on page 404). A creature can move through a space you occupy, whether or not it is your ally. Each square you occupy, however, counts as 2 squares to move through.</h3>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
