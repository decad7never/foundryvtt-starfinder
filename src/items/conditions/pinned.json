While you are pinned, you can&rsquo;t move and are @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.MZ8OoH1GE9qDMyCD]{Flat-Footed}. You also take an additional &ndash;4 penalty to your Armor Class, attack rolls, Reflex saving throws, initiative checks, and Dexterity-based skill and ability checks (these penalties replace those from the @Compendium[sfrpg.conditions.4AkWDHGM6gHDepHN]{Grappled} condition and also apply to attempts to grapple your opponent or free yourself; see Grapple on page 246). You are limited in the actions that you can take. You cannot take any action that requires the use of any of your limbs, but you can always attempt to free yourself, usually through an attack roll or Acrobatics check. You can&rsquo;t make attacks of opportunity while you are pinned, but you can still take verbal and mental actions, such as spellcasting.</h3>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
